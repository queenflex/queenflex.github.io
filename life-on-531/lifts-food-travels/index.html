<div class="content">
  <p>This week has flown by, and I promise you, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten about the &ldquo;life on 5/3/1&rdquo; series. This is going to be a bit of a longer article recapping my week, some travel, workouts, and food (because, who could forget talking about what they eat during a training program?).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just jump to it.</p>

<p>Last week, I don&rsquo;t even know what happened. It&rsquo;s like I woke up and did a bunch of things, but can&rsquo;t really remember what I did or when I did it. That&rsquo;s kind of how life goes between travelling, working 10+ hour shifts, and of course, the HOLIDAYS! Did I mention we&rsquo;re 5 days out from Christmas?! How did that happen? 2016 was so short-lived. Anyone else feel like we aren&rsquo;t ready for 2017?</p>

<p>Continuing my talk about last week&hellip;let&rsquo;s talk first about training:</p>

<h3 id="5-3-1-training-progress">5/3/1 training progress</h3>

<p>I managed to meet my training plans as mentioned in <a href="https://queenflex.github.io/post/article-3_5-3-1/">Article 3 - real talk in the real life</a>, which is awesome considering I just came off a brief cold. Squats still feel &ldquo;weak&rdquo; for me, and as I start to think about my fitness purpose for 2017, I definitely want to make sure I include Squat form and strength to the list of things to accomplish. Saturday morning deadlifts were on point, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this weekend&rsquo;s session (back to the good ole Hartford YMCA!). The only sad part about Saturday morning deadlifts is the fact that I am no longer having waffles as part of the post-workout routine. <em><a href="https://queenflex.github.io/post/article-1_5-3-1/">You can read more about my efforts in going Gluten Free in the first article.</a></em></p>

<p><u> Spoiler Alert:</u> so far mission Gluten Free has been a <em>failure</em> for a couple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>My skin is still acne-ridden.</li>
<li>My digestion is all over the place.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that said, I&rsquo;m still going to continue being Gluten Free for another few months, with the hope that my skin and digestive problems will clear up over time.</p>

<h4 id="this-week-s-training-schedule">this week&rsquo;s training schedule</h4>

<p>Due to travel Sunday - Tuesday my workouts have been rearranged this week. I&rsquo;m also feeling a spur of mid-to-upper back/low neck stiffness, which is usually a sign that I need to rest and stretch out my neck and shoulders. I&rsquo;m hoping that will resolve itself in a few days, as it&rsquo;s pretty gnarly trying to move or &ldquo;crane&rdquo; my neck in multiple directions. (You&rsquo;d be surprised how often you do this in a given day!).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what my estimated training plan is for this week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sun - &ldquo;rest&rdquo; / travelling</li>
<li>Mon - &ldquo;rest&rdquo; / travelling</li>
<li>Tues - &ldquo;rest&rdquo; / travelling</li>
<li>Wed - Squats</li>
<li>Thurs - Military Press</li>
<li>Fri - Deadlift</li>
<li>Sat - Bench (pending an open gym on Dec 24)</li>
<li>Sun - HIIT/Abs at home (Christmas Day)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those of you who follow this blog know that I am a HUGE fan of the <a href="https://queenflex.github.io/links#strongapp">Strong App</a>. I just want to take a moment and share with you the progress I&rsquo;ve made on my estimated 1RM for the big 4 during 2016. All weights are measured in pounds, below.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize how much <u> tracking</u> helps with making <strong>progress</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re starting, how will you know where you&rsquo;re going?</em></p>

<p>Take a look at the Strong App, let me know what you think, and make that effort to log all your workouts!</p>

<h3 id="food-enough-said">FOOD. <em>enough said</em></h3>

<p>Friday and Saturday were packing and prepare for travel days. Sunday through today (Tuesday) were travel across the U.S. (First a short trip to Texas, then to Connecticut to spend time with family.) Let&rsquo;s just say that my diet was far from perfect. Something I want to emphasize here is a common notion of &ldquo;under-eating&rdquo;. When you&rsquo;re on an IIFYM diet, it&rsquo;s really important to actually <u>hit</u> the macros: not more, not less, but as close to the numbers as possible. Chronically under-eating is certainly a problem I pick up periodically due to shifts in my lifestyle. (The busier I tend to be, the easier it is for me to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to eat or &ldquo;under-eat&rdquo;.) It&rsquo;s a habit I need to work on breaking, which is why I&rsquo;m going to provide some tips as to how to hit your macros while constantly on-the-go.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with a brief commentary about airport foods and restaurants, and then shift gears to travelling with already prepared food.</p>

<h4 id="buy-this-food-at-the-airport">buy <strong>[this]</strong> food at the airport</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s often easier and more expensive to buy food at the airport rather than bringing it. If you have the financial means to pick something up at the airport, I personally recommend it, for convenience and food safety purposes. <em>(There&rsquo;s nothing worse than trying to eat that smelly, warm chicken that&rsquo;s been mushed in your bag while you&rsquo;re traveling.)</em></p>

<p>Here are some ideas for food choices while you&rsquo;re at the airport. Remember, it&rsquo;s all about hitting your macros, so if it fits, go ahead and eat it. And these tips are most applicable to short-haul flights and not your 8+ hour trips. I&rsquo;ve linked the nutritional information to the restaurant/food name to give you an idea of the calories and macros for each item.</p>

<h4 id="foods">foods</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/subway-double-chicken-chopped-salad-all-veggies-no-cheese-dressing-350179610">Subway | Chopped Salad Double Chicken</a>: Since I&rsquo;ve been eating gluten-free for the past few weeks, I like getting their chopped salad with double chicken and spicy brown mustard.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fatsecret.com/Diary.aspx?pa=fjrd&amp;rid=896256">Pinkberry | Original Tart Yogurt Small</a>: I always seem to get dehydrated while traveling, so something about this frozen original tart makes me feel refreshed without feeling stuffed. Other than the high sugar content, fro-yo is something I&rsquo;ll occasionally get if it&rsquo;s later in the day, and I have some carb macros to play with.</li>
<li><a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1809/2">Any newstand | Fruit: Apples, Bananas</a>: For shelf-life and longevity, I like getting apples over bananas, but for a quick snack, a banana is a great choice as well. These are great choices for boosting your micronutrients as well as fiber for the day!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/nutrition-facts-calories/quest-bar">Any newstand | QuestBar/Protein Bars</a>: I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of protein bars and shakes because I don&rsquo;t find them to taste overly good nor are they overly filling. But if cost is a problem and you want a quick snack, this will do!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="drinks">drinks</h4>

<p>I am always dehydrated while I travel, so I think it&rsquo;s important to be sure you pick up a bottle of water and drink it throughout the day! Since you can&rsquo;t bring liquids through airport security, you can either purchase a bottle once you pass the TSA screening, or you can bring an empty waterbottle and have it filled up by a restaurant, bar, fast food place, or water fountain.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/zero-ultra-white-monster-energy-drink-drink-378945313?v2=false">Any newstand | White Monster Energy Zero</a>: If I&rsquo;m not feeling a hot coffee, I&rsquo;ll grab a cold Monster for the caffeine, and because they taste good! They&rsquo;re relatively expensive at the airport, but I figure the can has two servings and a tall coffee from Starbucks is about the same price per serving.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/starbucks/sugar-free-mocha-syrup">Starbucks | Tall Dark Roast with 2 pumps of SF Mocha</a>: I wasn&rsquo;t usually a &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; Starbucks drink person, but this one has become a travel favorite because it tastes like hot chocolate with coffee and has all the flavor without all the calories. I&rsquo;ve linked you to the SF Mocha nutrition facts, which for two pumps is about 10 calories! Not too shabby! But of course, if you have the macros to <em>spend</em>, by all means get a higher caloric drink. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="if-you-re-going-to-meal-prep-before-travelling-this-is-what-you-should-do">if you&rsquo;re going to meal-prep before travelling, this is what you should do</h4>

<ol>
<li>Cook up a batch of protein (chicken, beef) and a batch of carbs (rice, pasta, etc.) and store them in large zip baggies.</li>
<li>Pack yourself one or two tupperware with lids and cutlery.</li>
<li>Pack some napkins.</li>
<li>Store inside of a cooler or bag with a small, TSA-approved ice pack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also be sure to call your hotel ahead of time to request a refrigerator and microwave within your room.</p>

<p>This method is best performed if you&rsquo;re going to be gone for a certain period of time that you know you need to have meals pre-made or if you&rsquo;re on a prep where all your food has to be accounted for. With all the different restaurants and grocery stores available, it&rsquo;s almost too easy to buy food when you arrive at your destination and make food within your hotel room. Some of my staples for in-room cooking with a microwave are:</p>

<p><u>carbs:</u></p>

<ul>
<li>oatmeal</li>
<li>minute rice</li>
<li>cream of rice</li>
<li>microwavable frozen veggies</li>
<li>microwavable frozen bagels, waffles, etc.</li>
<li>fruits: apples, bananas</li>
</ul>

<p><u>proteins:</u></p>

<ul>
<li>greek yogurt</li>
<li>cottage cheese</li>
<li>protein powders</li>
<li>precooked chicken</li>
<li>frozen chicken</li>
<li>eggs</li>
</ul>

<p><u>fats:</u></p>

<ul>
<li>almonds</li>
<li>cashews</li>
<li>peanut butter</li>
</ul>

<p>If your room includes breakfast, there&rsquo;s often cereals, hard boiled eggs, and scrambled eggs! IIFYM is supposed to be a simpler way of maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Don&rsquo;t over-complicate things by avoiding certain foods.</p>
