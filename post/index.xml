      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;stop-being-such-a-slouch&#34;&gt;Stop being such a slouch!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and work a desk job, it is easy to turn into a slouched over mess. With all the hype out there about &amp;ldquo;sitting is the new smoking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prehab is rehab&amp;rdquo;, I have decided to create a list of the most realistic exercises that you can do at the office to help improve posture, mobility, and overall happiness. &lt;em&gt;And hopefully prevent you from looking like a stupid fool, rolling around on the floor next to your cubical.&lt;/em&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: the advice I&amp;rsquo;m providing here is based off of my personal experience with chronic low back, hip, neck, and shoulder pain, and does not substitute or replace medical advice. These tricks have worked for me based on meeting with a physical therapist for my own mobility/stability issues; however, everybody is different, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to seek an opinion from your doctor prior to trying a rehab/stretch/strength program like the one I am about to outline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to working a full-time desk job, I was a college student. When people think college, they may think parties, alcohol, weight gain, and craziness; however, the reality of my college experience was hair-pulling, weight loss, walking everywhere, and craziness. Once I found myself sitting at the same desk for hours on end with little reason to move other than to get water or use the bathroom, I realized I was becoming a slouched over mess. [Cue the mobility issues, back and hip pain.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this &amp;ldquo;neat&amp;rdquo; little thing about exercise: you can work out for an hour—maybe even two hours—a day, but if you are &lt;a href=&#34;http://breakingmuscle.com/health-medicine/its-not-your-metabolism-its-your-neat-thats-stopping-your-fat-loss&#34;&gt;inactive for 8-15 hours a day, then exercise less effective&lt;/a&gt;. So why is that so “neat” you may ask? Well it has to do with &lt;strong&gt;N.E.A.T or non-exercise activity thermogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;, aka “what you do when you’re not exercising, which burns calories to keep you alive.” So if you put yourself into a lethargic, slumped over position all day long, and think you will have great mobility for your squat session that evening, well good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-prevent-becoming-an-immobile-mess-of-a-human-being&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I prevent becoming an immobile mess of a human being?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simple answer:&lt;/u&gt; get off your butt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simple answer explained:&lt;/u&gt; Every 30-45 minutes, get up and perform a series of mobility/stability exercises to counterbalance the poor posture from sitting. Think back to eighth-grade science class where you learned about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-4/Newton-s-Third-Law&#34;&gt;Newton’s Third Law&lt;/a&gt;. (For you engineers out there, forgive me, this was a very recent topic for y’all). Newton’s Third Law states that for every action force there is a reaction force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, if you’re sitting in a slouched over position, inducing flexion on your spine, it’d be wise to get up every half hour and do some back bends to induce extension. Refer to the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Terms-of-Movement-Flexion-and-Extension-CC-1024x815.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;45%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-15-minute-routine-to-combat-office-slouch&#34;&gt;A 15-minute routine to combat office slouch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a reason why people who live in a constant state of flexion throw their backs out when they pick up a basket of laundry; it’s because they’re inducing extension on a spine that has been molded into the flexion world. It’s time to teach our spines, and other body parts for that matter, what neutral looks like. To do this, I have developed a short list of five exercises that I think are the most effective for resetting the body and prehab for future injuries. You only need therabands/resistance bands to perform all the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you live in the world of &lt;u&gt;extension&lt;/u&gt;, you would probably benefit from &lt;u&gt;flexion&lt;/u&gt; exercises instead of exercises two and three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder W&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt;
Grasp a theraband on either end keep your elbows by your sides. Contract your lats and pull the band apart forming a &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; with your arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_G0feLqXA0E&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing back-bends (extension)&lt;/strong&gt;
Position your feet slightly behind your hips. Place your hands on your low back (or table as shown in the video), and slowly bend backwards. You will feel this stretch in your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjXCgxajrY4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prone Press-ups (extension)&lt;/strong&gt;
Lie on the floor and place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Contract your lats and press up with your arms. You should feel a stretch in the low back. Exhale at the top of the movement for a deeper low-back stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCOt_Em11g8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder Stars&lt;/strong&gt;
Grasp a theraband on either end and hit 6 points to form the shape of a star as shown in the video. Contract your lats and make sure that your shoulders are relaxed and not shrugged up towards your ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTCvBqZz3Bc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/strong&gt;
Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart and that you contract your glutes while hinging at the hips. When you come down, try to break just below parallel and come back up. If you feel this in your lower back, you should compare your form to the example in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3g4wAsu0R4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to perform these exercises every 30-45 minutes (set a timer!) throughout the work day to prevent poor posture and to prehab the body from potential future injuries. Hopefully, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to hit the gym, your body is already primed for the upcoming movements and you&amp;rsquo;ll be less stiff and sore afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give these exercises a try, and let me know if they work for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>how to meal prep over a weekend</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/how-to-meal-prep/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2016 12:26:50 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Short on time? Hate cooking? Or do you enjoy cooking but want to try something new in the kitchen? I typically meal prep over the course of a weekend by first making a protein and a carb dish and then mixing them together. In this article, I will walk you through this process of making simple, delicious meals that you can grab-and-go throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;center&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cHlo3X4gvbE/VpvNlrZTydI/AAAAAAAAA5c/0oVTGC635kM/s400/IMG_0156.JPG&#34; width=&#34;95%&#34; height=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prepare-your-protein-source-chicken&#34;&gt;Prepare Your Protein Source (Chicken)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve prepped my meals over the course of two days: Saturday and Sunday. Friday night I washed, trimmed, and seasoned two chicken breasts and placed them in a small crock pot to cook on low for 8 hours overnight. Saturday morning, the chicken was perfectly tender and easy to shred with tongs. Next, I divided the shredded chicken into six portions. I put the chicken away in the fridge and paused the rest of my meal prep until Sunday. Check out this article for additional ways to &lt;a href=&#34;http://queenflex.github.io/post/perfect-chicken/&#34;&gt;cook perfect chicken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-some-carbs-potatoes&#34;&gt;Add Some Carbs (Potatoes)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning, I washed, peeled, and diced up two sweet potatoes and one white potato. I also elected to use up some Alexa Sweet Potato fries from my freezer. I set the oven to 425-deg F and baked the fries for about 25 minutes and the diced potatoes for about 35 minutes or until brown. Once the potatoes were cooked, I took the six portions of shredded chicken out of the fridge and put about 150g of potatoes into each container. Click here for more information about &lt;a href=&#34;http://queenflex.github.io/post/cooked-sweet-potatoes/&#34;&gt;cooking perfect sweet potatoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finalize-with-veggies-seasonings-and-sauces&#34;&gt;Finalize with Veggies, Seasonings, and Sauces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m huge on using frozen veggies because I think the taste and cost per serving is unbeatable compared to fresh veggies. Fresh veggies have a lifespan, and if for whatever reason I don&amp;rsquo;t eat all the veggies I buy within a few days, I end up wasting food. I typically buy the microwavable frozen veggie bags because they provide about 3-4 servings per bag, which is great for meal prep. This weekend, I cooked a bag of California blend (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots), and added it to the shredded chicken and potato meals. Feel free to mix it up and use whatever veggies you like. By incorporating veggies into the pre-made meals, it forces you to eat your vegetables because they&amp;rsquo;re already cooked and included with the other foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add seasonings: salt, pepper, Mrs. Dash, etc, as well as sauces: hot sauce, salsa, ketchup, mustard, or salad dressings to make the meals more flavorful. I tend to add these dressings or sauces on just before I&amp;rsquo;m about to eat the meal so that the food doesn&amp;rsquo;t get soggy in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tl-dr-meal-prep-isn-t-difficult&#34;&gt;TL;DR: Meal Prep Isn&amp;rsquo;t Difficult&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a good chef or even spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Between the two days of meal prep, I probably spent about an hour total and was able to make six meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key steps to meal prep are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a protein source that you like to eat: chicken, beef, fish, tofu, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a carb source that you also like to eat: potatoes, rice, pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some veggies, seasonings, and sauces.
If your meal plan requires added fats such as olive oil or nuts, feel free to add those in too. Be sure to emphasize choosing foods you LIKE; otherwise, it will be much more difficult to eat the meals you&amp;rsquo;ve prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use shortcuts such as crockpot shredded chicken, minute rice, and frozen microwavable veggies to help save time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portion foods using the typical serving size per bag or with a small food scale. With time and practice your meal prep skills will improve, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to mix and match multiple protein and carb sources to have a diverse selection of meals for the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tired of dried, bland, and burnt rubber chicken?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 2016 right around the corner, and meal prep headed into full swing within the next few weeks, here is an article to help you prepare delicious, juicy chicken every time. The following article explains my top 3 methods of preparing chicken for use in delicious dinners and dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4gfh0CU-FfM/VoWWZbM-vkI/AAAAAAAAA3Q/TZqq1KLGEU0/w250-h160-c/Grilled-Chicken3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;95%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;u-method-1-u-wash-trim-and-season-chicken-before-cooking&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Method #1:&lt;/u&gt;  Wash, Trim, and Season Chicken BEFORE cooking.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before baking, grilling, frying, or boiling, be sure to wash and trim the chicken. I typically use cold water and a pair of kitchen scissors to trim off extra fat. I recommend these pair of scissors from Walmart. They&amp;rsquo;re very affordable and sharp enough to cut meat. When they&amp;rsquo;re dull, I just buy a new pair. Once you finish washing and trimming the chicken breasts, you are ready to add seasonings or marinades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;these-are-some-of-my-favorite-seasonings&#34;&gt;These are some of my favorite seasonings:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic Italian Seasonings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mustard (powder or condiment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red pepper flakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balsamic Vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bolthouse Farms Italian Dressing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be creative with your seasonings. If you are big into BBQ chicken, then find some BBQ marinades or rubs. Just be mindful of the sodium content since some of the seasonings can have high salt contents While sodium is helpful for athletes, too much of anything can cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;u-method-2-u-flip-once-when-you-grill-chicken&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Method #2: &lt;/u&gt;  Flip Once when you Grill Chicken.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite way to cook chicken is on the grill. The chicken is crispy and juicy and usually tastes great even as leftovers! The key to grilling chicken is to have a hot grill (at least 450-deg F) and to flip the chicken breasts once every 10-12 minutes. This allows each side to obtain perfect grill marks and to become both crispy and juicy. Note: depending on the size/weight of the chicken breast, you may need to adjust the time and temperature so that it is fully cooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;u-method-3-u-set-it-and-forget-it-crockpot-chicken-shredded-chicken&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Method #3:&lt;/u&gt;  Set it and forget it. CrockPot Chicken = Shredded Chicken.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: right;&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--bfn1ttBdk4/VoWVGj2DDiI/AAAAAAAAA3I/4SwphTXOZ6M/s320/IMG_0101.JPG&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;60%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work a full-time job or are a full-time student without a lot of time to cook chicken, I highly recommend this method. Put two to three chicken breasts in a small CrockPot (8qt), set on high, and then forget it. The chicken will cook through in two to four hours and can be turned or checked every so often. For added flavor, see &lt;strong&gt;Method #1 above:&lt;/strong&gt; Wash, trim, and season with your favorite flavors! When the chicken is fully cooked, take two forks and pull the chicken apart for a ready-made-meal in minutes. Sometimes I will use the shredded chicken in other dishes such as my Italian Chicken Lasagna or &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitmencook.com/fit-healthy-chicken-rice-enchilada-casserole/&#34;&gt;Healthy Chicken &amp;amp; Rice Enchiladas from FitMenCook&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a super simple way to get a lot of chicken cooked without having to babysit a stove, oven, or grill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a mini guide on supplements</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/supplement-guide/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2015 17:25:08 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why shell out hundreds of dollars per month on useless supplements when you can have all the health benefits for under $75? Supplements are not magic and will not get the results you have not been working for; they are only useful if you have been working out smart and eating to support your energy balance and training goals. Over the years, my opinions about supplements have changed dramatically: initially I bought into the trendy supplement stacks promoted by famous and aesthetic bodybuilders whom are often receiving free products from the companies they are endorsed by. For this reason alone, it is important to choose supplements based on your own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-66lpbJ3zzCo/VmNQda3zQvI/AAAAAAAAAyA/s6AK5_LQdL8/s640/bs-thumb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a goal, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thinking about supplements! Be critical of yourself. Map out your workout and nutrition plans first before complicating the process with the wealth, media, and pop-culture out there surrounding the &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts&amp;rdquo; of supplementation. In this article, I will outline my current (and minimalistic) approach to supplementation as well as tips you can use to build a meaningful supplementation stack for less than $75.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;supplements-so-many-choices-so-few-that-matter&#34;&gt;Supplements: So Many Choices, So Few That Matter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of mainstream fitness and the high profitability of supplement companies comes a wealth of random products that may or may not be suitable for taking based on your goals. I base my supplementation around two key components: #1 DIET, #2 TRAINING. Because I am a huge proponent of EatToPerform, I have been slowly introducing the concept of wave dieting the past few months. (You can read more about the wave diet on ETP&amp;rsquo;s website.) My current goal (as of Dec 2015) is to average 2000 calories daily: 140g protein, 298g carbs, 50g fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might ask:&lt;/em&gt; Ok Liz, what does this have to do with supplementation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And really, the answer is quite simple:&lt;/em&gt; I will only supplement to help meet my macros if eating whole foods alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Postulate #1:&lt;/u&gt; If eating three whole food meals including lean meats, chicken, fish, etc doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me meet my protein goals for the day, only then will I add in a protein supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My go-to protein supplement is Whey Protein Isolate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UKV6Fxp9skU/VmNTvgeOvsI/AAAAAAAAAyM/Zd4GdCwFW7k/s320/performance-whey.jpg&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;45%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a liking to Optimum Nutrition&amp;rsquo;s Performance Whey Isolate. The ingredients label is easy-to-read, the macronutrients fit my needs, and it&amp;rsquo;s affordable (~$35-50  for 50 servings).
There is an exception to Postulate #1, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Exception #1:&lt;/u&gt; If I know I will be having an intense workout that day (HIIT, Heavy Deadlifts, Heavy Squats, etc), I will supplement with Whey Protein Isolate within 30-minutes post-workout. I feel that this method helps speed up recovery for me and reduces soreness/delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) within the following two days. The main reason why I prefer Whey Protein Isolate over blends, concentrates, caseinate, vegan/vegetarian/soy proteins, etc. is because Whey Protein Isolate is fast-absorption and typically gives you the most protein for the price. To me, if I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy a protein supplement, I want it to contain protein, not fillers, nor proprietary blends, and junk that I have no real reason to put into my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Postulate #2:&lt;/u&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s important to check the supplement for purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nifty website that is focused on supplement quality and value is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.labdoor.com&#34;&gt;Labdoor&lt;/a&gt;. You can search for supplements, and if Labdoor has run quality/purity tests on the product, you will get the lab test results. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to verify that what you&amp;rsquo;re buying and using is a safe product filled with the ingredients reported on the label. With that said, a few other Whey Protein Isolate brands I recommend are Myprotein&amp;rsquo;s Impact Whey Isolate, and Isopure Whey Isolate. &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.myprotein.com/referrals.list?applyCode=LIZ-R4T&amp;amp;li&#34;&gt;Get 10% off your order on myprotein.com&lt;/a&gt; when you make a purchase with my link!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Postulate #3:&lt;/u&gt; Take Fish Oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/56405802.jpg&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone, active or not, should be supplementing with fish oil. Unless you eat salmon every day, you will not reach an optimal level of Omega-3&amp;rsquo;s. You can read more about fish oil and the required dosages here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone should be supplementing with 1g Fish Oil/day; active people should be closer to 6g Fish Oil/day. I currently supplement with Vitamin Shoppe&amp;rsquo;s Fish Oil due to its high quality/purity and value ratings on Labdoor. One thing to note about fish oil is that it should be bought in &lt;strong&gt;SMALLER&lt;/strong&gt; packages to reduce the effects of oxidation. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to store fish oil in the refrigerator/freezer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt; Postulate #4: &lt;/u&gt; Maximize Post-Workout Gains with Creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;center&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HP2qviiAniI/VmNZzq63JCI/AAAAAAAAAyg/kZzwNH-AktA/s640/creatine-safe.png&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;95%&#34; height=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Creatine is safe. Because creatine is well-researched, it is &amp;ldquo;remarkably safe for most people.&amp;rdquo; One of my favorite websites for verifying the safety of products is Examine.com. Not only can you learn more about creatine, but you can search nearly any supplement or drug, and you can learn more about nutrition. Examine.com will provide you dosage information as well as how to maximize absorption of the supplements you decide to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some creatine products I recommend are Con-Cret by ProMera Sports (Creatine HCl) and Creatine Monohydrate from Myprotein. Both have &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; ratings on Labdoor, and I have had good results from both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-make-a-supplement-stack-for-less-than-75-month&#34;&gt;How to Make a Supplement Stack for less than $75/month:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tips provided above, we can now discuss my $75/month supplement stack. I am not affiliated nor receive a commission for providing you with the brands of products given in my recommendations below. As always, you should consult with your doctor or health professional before starting a health or supplementation program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a Reputable Whey Protein Isolate (2 servings/day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimum Nutrition Performance Whey Isolate $39 for 4.4lb, 40 days, $1/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick out Fish Oil (~3g/day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin Shoppe Fish Oil - $16 for 60 caps x 2 = $32 for 120 caps, 40 days, $0.80/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy Creatine (1 serving/day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myprotein Creatine Monohydrate - $11 for 226g, 45 days, $0.28/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-off with missing Micronutrients/Minerals (1 cap or serving/day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin Shoppe Vitamin D 1000IU- $8 for 200 caps, $0.04/day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin Shoppe Vitamin K 100 Mcg- $5 for 100 caps, $0.05/day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;s&gt; Natural Calm Magnesium - $18 for 56 servings, $0.32/day. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 11/24/16: I no longer recommend Natural Calm Magnesium due to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://labdoor.com/article/labdoors-statement-natural-vitality-calm&#34;&gt;labdoor press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-74-70-days-30&#34;&gt;Total - $74.70 # Days- 30&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr-summary&#34;&gt;TL;DR (Summary):&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. A starter plan for what supplements to buy, and how to choose meaningful supplements. The first step with any goal is to create your diet and exercise plan; once you have a solid foundation and are eating to match your energy expenditure, you can then add in supplements to help with recovery time and muscle growth. It is important to understand what ingredients you&amp;rsquo;re putting into your body and the safety of the supplements you choose to buy. For that very reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended educating yourself about products before buying and trying. My favorite websites for scientific-based evidence on reputable supplements and dosing information are Labdoor.com and Examine.com. It&amp;rsquo;s your life. Be smart about your supplementation and spending. Don&amp;rsquo;t fall into the pitfall of needing a &amp;ldquo;magic pill&amp;rdquo; to get the results you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you use any of these supplements? Are you surprised by my recommendations? Drop a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sweet Potatoes are absolutely delicious when cooked properly. This recipe teaches you how to cook sweet potatoes in the oven. It&amp;rsquo;s the simplest recipe of them all because it only requires one ingredient, the amazingly delicious sweet potato - baked to perfection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;em&gt;Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated -Confucius&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9zuFURlAugc/VmM7NaMDNCI/AAAAAAAAAxY/FYRvQZub9V8/s320/sweet-potatoes.jpg&#34; width=&#34;95%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1500g Sweet Potatoes (I decided to make a large batch to use throughout the week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potato Peeler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutting board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitchen Scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-stick cooking spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oven Mits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375-deg F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash and peel the sweet potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop each potato into rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line baking sheets with aluminum foil. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the sweet potatoes to the baking sheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, flip, and then bake on the opposite side for another 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove from the oven and let cool before eating. Feel free to add seasonings (garlic, italian seasonings, etc) before the potatoes fully cool. They&amp;rsquo;re so sweet on their own that I like to have them plain :D&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s meal is a healthy version of a favorite recipe of mine, growing up: Mom&amp;rsquo;s Healthy Meatballs. (Shoutout to my wonderful Mother!) If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a delicious recipe that&amp;rsquo;s both healthy and easy, look no further. I&amp;rsquo;ve combined lean ground beef with diced tomatoes to make a warm, wintery meal suitable for any appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;center&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h1OcmdRjb8w/ViaTfVFw3-I/AAAAAAAAAv8/6sJqEFJgfeQ/s320/IMG_1278.JPG&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16oz lean ground beef (I typically buy 93% lean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30g Bothouse Farms Italian Dressing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30g Reduced Fat Mexican Cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 can Diced Tomatoes - No Salt Added&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic powder, salt, pepper, Italian seasonings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large skillet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bowl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitchen Scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oven dish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tongs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid measuring cup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-stick cooking spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix ground beef, Italian dressing, garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasonings together in a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weigh out four 4oz portions using the kitchen scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide each 4oz portion into four 1oz portions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat a large skillet on high. Spray with non-stick cooking spray and lightly coat the pan with some Italian seasonings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the pan is hot, add all of the meatballs to it. Cook the meatballs for roughly 3 minutes each side or until both sides have browned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 375-deg F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coat the oven dish with non-stick cooking spray and add half of the can of diced tomatoes to the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the meatballs from the skillet and add to the oven dish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coat each meatball with the remaining diced tomatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add cheese to the top and additional seasonings, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake at 375-deg F for 20-25 minutes or until the meatballs are fully cooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let cool for 10 minutes. Pair with a side of spaghetti or veggies and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

In this recipe, I teach you how to make a delicious, healthy, chocolate cake from scratch using fresh ingredients: chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, and raspberries. My chocolate lava cake is healthy, tasty, and easy, taking 20 minutes to prepare and 1 hour to cook. No baby-sitting the oven; just add the ingredients to the crock pot and let the heat do its magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HxYMlo9dexE/Vg_iaXVOy_I/AAAAAAAAAs4/3Nr2eqBYbLc/s400/blogger-image--7980637.jpg&#34; width=&#34;95%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Cake Batter: (Feel free to substitute store-bought cake mix; however, the macronutrients will be way different!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eOjBw_cvzvg/Vg_zcuh4YII/AAAAAAAAAuY/dkLGk0qIgWk/s400/NutritionLabel-3.png&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 Large Egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; c. Unsweetened Cocoa Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tsp. Baking Soda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tsp. Baking Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Packet Stevia/Truvia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch of Sea Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15g Pancake Mix (I used Great Value from Walmart)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 oz. Fage 2% Plain Greek Yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; Cake Batter Adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rippedrecipes.com/recipe/macro-friendly-chocolate-cupcake-2966.html&#34;&gt;Ripped Recipes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Fudge Component:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 c. Fat Free Skim Milk&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30g Cacao 60% Dark Chocolate Chips (I used Ghirardelli) Filling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Toppings: (Because you really need more love after all of that)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 Fresh or frozen raspberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68g/1 Serving of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pour into the crock pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix the skim milk into the pudding pie filling. Wisk until smooth. (Do not worry about mixing until the pudding sets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour the pudding mixture into the crock pot.Use the spatula to remove any remaining batter from the small mixing bowl. (Nothing goes to waste!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprinkle in the 60% Dark Chocolate chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the crock pot to high heat and add the lid.8. Let cook for 1-1.5 hours or until the mixture is cooked and has risen.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s meal is a seasonal pre-workout packed with carbs and protein to give you that extra kick during your workout. For those of you who love utilizing the flavors of fall, freshly picked apples go perfectly with this quick, 15 minute snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add oats to small pot. Fill with ~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cup of water (almond milk or milk) or until the top of the oats are covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir in cinnamon and stevia/Truvia, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn stove to high heat and let the oats/seasonings mixture heat until the oats start to bubble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce heat to low and stir the oat mixture. This process is similar to cooking oatmeal on the stove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop up the apple into cubes. Feel free to remove the peel, if desired. I leave the peel on for extra crunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the apples with the oatmeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the apples and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the Vanilla Greek Yogurt to the bottom of a heat-safe bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The oatmeal/apples mixture is fully cooked when the apples are soft and 80%+ of the water has been absorbed by the oats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour the oatmeal/apples mixture into the heat-safe bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top with the remaining &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; apples and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the Vanilla Greek Yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprinkle with cinnamon and stevia/Truvia, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let cool and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you craving this classic taste of Fall, and your macros don&amp;rsquo;t allow for the traditional chicken pot pie recipe, give this a try! For under 300 calories, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a tasty dose of this deliciously seasonal, healthy chicken pot pie made with fresh ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the Meal Prep Series, this week&amp;rsquo;s meal is Mini Chicken Pot Pies (adopted and modified from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/recipe/chicken/mini-chicken-pot-pies/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; original recipe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-byQuTHmmeKo/VgdRcPo_jzI/AAAAAAAAArY/ed78Y2tvwDo/s640/blogger-image-1255513652.jpg&#34; width=&#34;85%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZUqU8qzH4Ak/VgdTQEErGHI/AAAAAAAAArs/rFrMx5S_OoA/s320/NutritionLabel.png&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;35%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80g yellow onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70g celery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30g baby carrots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cups Reduced-Sodium Chicken Broth (not all will be consumed; mainly used for cooking)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30g Bothouse Farms Italian Vinaigrette Dressing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Grands Jr Golden Layer Buttermilk Biscuits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 serving frozen veggies of your choice (I chose Kroger&amp;rsquo;s Recipe Secrets - Vegetable Soup, Mix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 oz Chicken Breast (Raw measure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italian Seasonings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Stick, Fat-Free Cooking Spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Pot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 single-serve oven-safe bowls or ramekins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kitchen Scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ladle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baking Rack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutting board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharp knife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn stove on high and coat large pot with non-stick spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop up onion, celery, and carrots. Mix with seasonings in the large pot. Cook until onions are browned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken broth and Italian Vinaigrette to large pot and let simmer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash and prep chicken breast. Cut into smaller pieces and add to large pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let simmer ~10 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add frozen veggies. Cook until completely thawed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce stove to low heat. Remove chicken and add to a separate bowl. Shred if desired using a fork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 400-deg F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the kitchen scale, find the total weight of chicken and divide by 4. This will be the serving size per mini chicken pie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add chicken and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of veggies to the single-serve oven-safe bowls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add ~1-2 tbsp of broth to the bowls. Season with more garlic, black pepper, italian seasonings, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flatten and mold the 4 Grands Jr Biscuits to fit the top of each of the single-serve oven-safe bowls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coat the top of the biscuits with a small amount (~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tsp) of left over broth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprinkle top of biscuits with more seasonings if desired. (I coated with some garlic powder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake for 8-12 minutes or until the biscuits are fully cooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let cool for 10 minutes and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait …what do I do with the left over broth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be left with ~90% of the chicken broth. Instead of throwing it out, I used it to cook the rest of my chicken as a part of my #MealPrepSunday. To do this, I added 3 raw chicken breasts and the chicken broth to a small crock pot and cooked on high for roughly 3 hours. Once the chicken was fully cooked, I removed it from the broth and shredded it down. I put 2 servings of chicken back into the crock pot with 2 servings of frozen veggies and 1 serving of tortellini to make a soup (YUM!). I let this cook for another 30-60 minutes on low heat. I packed up the remaining shredded chicken in a tupperware for use throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>daily fitness must-haves</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop right there. Yes, you. Did you forget something?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, you have a few staple items that you always leave the house with: wallet, keys, phone..(gum, ha)&amp;hellip;check. But what about the fitness enthusiasts out there. It seems like we are always carrying around more &lt;s&gt;random&lt;/s&gt; necessary things as we venture to work, the grocery store, or even the gym (gasp). So what things define you as part of the #fitfam? For me, I have a few staple items (other than those presented above) that seem to follow me wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fitmark-bag&#34;&gt;Fitmark Bag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; src=&#34;http://cdn.fitmarkbags.com//image/data/products/transporter-tote-2015/black/Transporter-Tote-Bag_black_front.png&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; width=&#34;45%&#34; height=&#34;45%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, I was in the market for a meal-prep/work/all-around bag to replace my kindergarten lunch box. I figured since I am now in the working world, I owe it to myself to look the part. It took me awhile to decide on a meal-prep bag; there are so many choose from&amp;ndash;Six Pack Bags to Isobag to Fitmark to Target&amp;rsquo;s dollar deal. I originally started off with the Renee Tote from Six Pack Bags and as beautiful of a bag as it was when it arrived, I could barely fit my laptop or a book or anything (besides food) in it. Very disappointing to say the least. Instead of holding on to a $160 meal bag that I had no use for, I began some research into my next bag. In June, the TranSPORTer tote from Fitmark Bags came out in black. It has the ability to hold a Small BOX with two meal containers as well as serve as a full duffle bag. As soon as it arrived, I did a quick test for storage and usability, and the rest is history; I don&amp;rsquo;t leave my house without my TranSPORTer tote. Talk about the best of both worlds: store two-to-three meals, plus a laptop/books/drinks/workout clothes all in one bag. Wonderful! So to those of you out there looking for an all-around bag, I highly recommend taking a look at Fitmark&amp;rsquo;s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notebook-workout-log&#34;&gt;Notebook/Workout Log&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I find myself listening to a podcast or reading an article or two and find myself jotting notes on random sheets of paper, only to lose those notes a week later. I decided to carry around a single-subject composition book along with my workout log so that I can keep all my fitness-related thoughts together in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workout logs have changed shape and form over the years of lifting. Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to designing my own workout log in iBooks based on my routine over a 12-week period. I include each workout, the respective exercises, sets and reps within a table, which makes it seamlessly easy to track progress and continuously work towards achieving a PR or goal. Check out my FREE &lt;a href=&#34;http://queenflex.blogspot.com/p/official-workout-log.html&#34;&gt;downloadable workout training log&lt;/a&gt; template!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lacrosse-tennis-yoga-tuneup-balls&#34;&gt;Lacrosse/Tennis/Yoga TuneUp Balls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know when you&amp;rsquo;ll have a trigger point or shooting shoulder pain. So why not be prepared with the right tools? Also since migrating to a stand-up desk, my feet and calves can use some extra love throughout the day. Plus, some days are just meant for fidgeting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-2-gallon-water-jug&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Gallon Water Jug&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; src=&#34;http://s4.thcdn.com/productimg/600/600/11133450-2084319696682723.jpg&#34; width=&#34;35%&#34; height=&#34;35%&#34;/&gt;
I never leave the house without my &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Gallon water jug. While it probably looks silly to some, I&amp;rsquo;m always thirsty (especially in the Arizona heat), so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that it becomes a conversation-starter in most social scenarios. Receive &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.myprotein.com/protein-accessories/myprotein-1-2-gallon-hydrator/11133450.html?feature=locale-popup&amp;amp;referringSite=myprotein_en_GB&amp;amp;countrySelected=Y&#34;&gt;10% off your order with the promo code &amp;ldquo;LIZ-R4T&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gallon hydrator on myprotein.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are your daily must-haves? Do you use any of these items as religiously as me? Comment below!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt; Note: I do not represent Fitmark Bags in any way, shape, or form. The opinions of this article are strictly mine, and I have not been compensated to say anything written in this article about any of these staple items.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>turn your injury into an opportunity</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/injury-to-opportunity/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2015 21:44:26 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/injury-to-opportunity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Injuries happen quite often in fitness and athletics in general–whether it is a minor case of the shin-splints or a broken bone, athletes are prone to getting hurt. Somehow it has become part of a vicious cycle; a known part of the game. But does it have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://spotmegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/@physio_fit.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past four years of my fit lifestyle I have managed to train my way through and around injuries. One of the key things I have learned is that many training-related injuries can be prevented. It all comes down to knowing your body and how it performs. There’s a difference between “cry-baby pain” and pain you should take seriously. Listening to your body is a true way to gauge this line. If your gut-instinct tells you to take a step back, then you should probably listen to it! Push through it, and you could miss more than a few reps or even steps in the long run!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, so now you’re telling me to just stop training when the alarm sounds?&lt;/em&gt;
Actually, I’m suggesting an alternative method, selective training. If you feel shin-splints coming on and you need to perform HIIT as part of your training regime, then stop the treadmill work. Switch to HIIT on a rower or elliptical machine. Even better, use this opportunity to go outside and ride a bicycle. Be the badass on a bike performing 1 minute of hard-out pedaling and 30 seconds of leisurely, relaxed riding. Turn your injury into a chance to rest that body part. There are over 500 muscles in the human body; if one of them needs a break, then switch your attention to the other 499-plus muscles that need work. Read on for some more great tips to turning an injury into an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;switch-to-body-weight-exercises&#34;&gt;Switch to Body-Weight Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel an injury coming on, switch to body weight exercises for a couple of days. This will reduce the stress placed on your body from lifting heavy. Plus, you will still get a great workout! Body-weight exercises allow you to concentrate on supporting your own weight through balance and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for more of a challenge? Try completing 500 reps of common body-weight exercises such as planks, pullups, sit-ups, and push-ups with a 7 minute cutoff time for each. Trust me, it’s more difficult than it sounds! You could also try switching it up and do multiple rounds of tabata: 20 seconds of reps followed by 10 seconds of rest for a total of 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternative-cardio-training&#34;&gt;Alternative Cardio Training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardio doesn’t have to be about running, biking, or elliptical work. Use this opportunity to go for a long hike, try out rock climbing, or even pick up boxing. Challenge yourself by trying something new. Even kayaking can be a great cardio workout! Be creative and think about opportunities you can take part in rather than worry about opportunities you’re missing out on due to an injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rehab-and-stretch&#34;&gt;Rehab and Stretch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times athletes get injured, go to physical therapy, finish up the sessions and then stop doing the exercises. I’ll admit, I’m not as proactive when it comes to doing the stretching and prep work before a workout. If you are given exercises by a physical therapist, be sure to do them! Stretching is a great way to prepare your body for the stresses of lifting. It promotes oxygen flow to the muscles and will help loosen you up beforehand. Use this time to throw in your favorite playlist and get pumped for the workout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shoulder-related-injury&#34;&gt;Shoulder-related Injury?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem. After a few rounds of surgery to remove a bone mass between my scapula and rib cage, I’ve become more aware of alternative shoulder and upper body exercises. Typically when I’m working shoulders and chest I will modify the flat bench press to an incline press just so that my shoulders aren’t under so much stress. I still get the added benefit of a dumbbell or barbell press just without the added tension. If you have another sensitive area from previous injuries, modified exercises always help and can get you on track to where you want to be without stopping a plan entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ice-down-and-heat-up&#34;&gt;Ice Down and Heat Up!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this recovery period as an excuse to relax with a heating pad or ice pack. Whether you like ice or heat, just relaxing after your workout with one or the other can help your muscles start to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that sometimes injuries are much more complex than a little case of the shin-splints. In complex injuries, you need to use your best judgement. Don’t push yourself to the point where you’re physically disintegrating. You’re training with a purpose. You want to become a better, more polished version of yourself. So instead of dropping all fitness entirely when an injury strikes, strike back and play smart. If upper body is injured, work legs. Go for a jog. Keep up your cardio. Do some active stretching and rehabilitation exercises. Be mindful of yourself and your goals, and take the time to turn your injury into an opportunity for future prevention and a successful recovery. Fitness is probably the greatest game composed of lifting, nutrition, and competition. Take care of yourself by doing the recommended stretches in preparation for your training routine. Your body will thank you for it afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you get hit with morning cravings for all the stuff you shouldn’t be eating? Try our take on a traditional McDonalds favorite, modified without the added fats, sugars, and unhealthiness. Tweet your recipes and modifications to this awesome breakfast sandwich!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cup 100% Liquid Egg Whites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 large whole Egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50g Plain Greek Yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50g Vanilla Greek Yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cup Quaker Quick Oats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 pinch Stevia (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2 pinches Ground Cinnamon (optional, but this really makes the dish tasty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Griddle/Stove Pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonstick cooking spray (fat free/cal free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ladle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn stove burner or griddle on high and coat with non-stick spray&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix all of the dry ingredients together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisk &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cup egg whites with the plain and vanilla Greek yogurts until the mixture is fluffy and smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Be careful not to over-mix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a ladle to add the griddler mixture to the stove pan/griddle. Wait until bubbly and then flip to cook each side. (similar process to making pancakes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour remaining &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cup of egg whites on the stove pan/griddle in a thin layer. Fry the whole egg as well. Flip once cooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plate the griddlers and add a small layer of the egg whites/fried egg to the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add another griddler to the top to make a sandwich, or leave open-faced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let cool and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;modifications&#34;&gt;Modifications:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PB2 or peanut butter on the underside of each griddler as a condiment for the sandwich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add chopped nuts to the dry ingredients to add a crunchiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve without the eggs as a stack of pancakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use all egg whites instead of adding in the whole egg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
