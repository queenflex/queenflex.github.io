<p><em>Stop right there. Yes, you. Did you forget something?</em></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you have a few staple items that you always leave the house with: wallet, keys, phone..(gum, ha)&hellip;check. But what about the fitness enthusiasts out there. It seems like we are always carrying around more <s>random</s> necessary things as we venture to work, the grocery store, or even the gym (gasp). So what things define you as part of the #fitfam? For me, I have a few staple items (other than those presented above) that seem to follow me wherever I go.</p>

<h3 id="fitmark-bag">Fitmark Bag</h3>

<p><img align="left" src="http://cdn.fitmarkbags.com//image/data/products/transporter-tote-2015/black/Transporter-Tote-Bag_black_front.png" hspace="20" width="315" height="315"/></p>

<p>About two months ago, I was in the market for a meal-prep/work/all-around bag to replace my kindergarten lunch box. I figured since I am now in the working world, I owe it to myself to look the part. It took me awhile to decide on a meal-prep bag; there are so many choose from&ndash;Six Pack Bags to Isobag to Fitmark to Target&rsquo;s dollar deal. I originally started off with the Renee Tote from Six Pack Bags and as beautiful of a bag as it was when it arrived, I could barely fit my laptop or a book or anything (besides food) in it. Very disappointing to say the least. Instead of holding on to a $160 meal bag that I had no use for, I began some research into my next bag. In June, the TranSPORTer tote from Fitmark Bags came out in black. It has the ability to hold a Small BOX with two meal containers as well as serve as a full duffle bag. As soon as it arrived, I did a quick test for storage and usability, and the rest is history; I don&rsquo;t leave my house without my TranSPORTer tote. Talk about the best of both worlds: store two-to-three meals, plus a laptop/books/drinks/workout clothes all in one bag. Wonderful! So to those of you out there looking for an all-around bag, I highly recommend taking a look at Fitmark&rsquo;s products.</p>

<h3 id="notebook-workout-log">Notebook/Workout Log</h3>

<p>Somehow I find myself listening to a podcast or reading an article or two and find myself jotting notes on random sheets of paper, only to lose those notes a week later. I decided to carry around a single-subject composition book along with my workout log so that I can keep all my fitness-related thoughts together in one place.</p>

<p>My workout logs have changed shape and form over the years of lifting. Most recently I&rsquo;ve taken to designing my own workout log in iBooks based on my routine over a 12-week period. I include each workout, the respective exercises, sets and reps within a table, which makes it seamlessly easy to track progress and continuously work towards achieving a PR or goal. Check out my FREE <a href="http://queenflex.blogspot.com/p/official-workout-log.html">downloadable workout training log</a> template!</p>

<h3 id="lacrosse-tennis-yoga-tuneup-balls">Lacrosse/Tennis/Yoga TuneUp Balls</h3>

<p>You never know when you&rsquo;ll have a trigger point or shooting shoulder pain. So why not be prepared with the right tools? Also since migrating to a stand-up desk, my feet and calves can use some extra love throughout the day. Plus, some days are just meant for fidgeting!</p>

<h3 id="1-2-gallon-water-jug"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> Gallon Water Jug</h3>

<p><img align="left" src="http://s4.thcdn.com/productimg/600/600/11133450-2084319696682723.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
I never leave the house without my <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> Gallon water jug. While it probably looks silly to some, I&rsquo;m always thirsty (especially in the Arizona heat), so I don&rsquo;t mind that it becomes a conversation-starter in most social scenarios.
