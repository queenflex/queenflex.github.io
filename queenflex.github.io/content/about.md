*My brain is a continuum of fitnessesque thoughts; I tend to think a lot about how to improve my life through fitness, nutrition, recovery, and lifestyle changes. In the queenflex blog you will find all the random and insightful fitness ideas I've decided to jot down. This collection of articles is based on what I've read and what I've learned through trial-and-error. So go ahead, read some articles, drop a comment (or two), and work with me to become the person you've dreamt of being.*
