* 80g yellow onion
* 70g celery
* 30g baby carrots
* 2 cups Reduced-Sodium Chicken Broth (not all will be consumed; mainly used for cooking)
* 30g Bothouse Farms Italian Vinaigrette Dressing
* 4 Grands Jr Golden Layer Buttermilk Biscuits
* 1 serving frozen veggies of your choice (I chose Kroger's Recipe Secrets - Vegetable Soup, Mix)
* 16 oz Chicken Breast (Raw measure)
* Italian Seasonings
* Non-Stick, Fat-Free Cooking Spray
* Garlic Powder
* Black Pepper

## Tools:
* Large Pot
* 4 single-serve oven-safe bowls or ramekins
* Kitchen Scale
* Spatula
* Ladle
* Baking Rack
* Cutting board
* Sharp knife

## Directions:
1. Turn stove on high and coat large pot with non-stick spray
2. Chop up onion, celery, and carrots. Mix with seasonings in the large pot. Cook until onions are browned.
3. Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken broth and Italian Vinaigrette to large pot and let simmer.
4. Wash and prep chicken breast. Cut into smaller pieces and add to large pot.
5. Let simmer ~10 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked.
6. Add frozen veggies. Cook until completely thawed.
7. Reduce stove to low heat. Remove chicken and add to a separate bowl. Shred if desired using a fork.
8. Preheat oven to 400-deg F.
9. Using the kitchen scale, find the total weight of chicken and divide by 4. This will be the serving size per mini chicken pie.
10. Add chicken and 1/4 of veggies to the single-serve oven-safe bowls. 
11. Add ~1-2 tbsp of broth to the bowls. Season with more garlic, black pepper, italian seasonings, if desired.
12. Flatten and mold the 4 Grands Jr Biscuits to fit the top of each of the single-serve oven-safe bowls.
13. Coat the top of the biscuits with a small amount (~1/2 tsp) of left over broth.
14. Sprinkle top of biscuits with more seasonings if desired. (I coated with some garlic powder).
15. Bake for 8-12 minutes or until the biscuits are fully cooked.
16. Let cool for 10 minutes and enjoy.

**But wait â€¦what do I do with the left over broth?**

You will be left with ~90% of the chicken broth. Instead of throwing it out, I used it to cook the rest of my chicken as a part of my #MealPrepSunday. To do this, I added 3 raw chicken breasts and the chicken broth to a small crock pot and cooked on high for roughly 3 hours. Once the chicken was fully cooked, I removed it from the broth and shredded it down. I put 2 servings of chicken back into the crock pot with 2 servings of frozen veggies and 1 serving of tortellini to make a soup (YUM!). I let this cook for another 30-60 minutes on low heat. I packed up the remaining shredded chicken in a tupperware for use throughout the week.
