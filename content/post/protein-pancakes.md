## Ingredients:
* 1⁄2 cup 100% Liquid Egg Whites
* 1 large whole Egg
* 50g Plain Greek Yogurt
* 50g Vanilla Greek Yogurt
* 1/2 cup Quaker Quick Oats
* 1 pinch Stevia (optional)
* 1-2 pinches Ground Cinnamon (optional, but this really makes the dish tasty)

## Tools:
* Griddle/Stove Pan
* Nonstick cooking spray (fat free/cal free) 
* Wisk
* Spatula
* Ladle

## Directions:
1. Turn stove burner or griddle on high and coat with non-stick spray
2. Mix all of the dry ingredients together
3. Wisk 1⁄4 cup egg whites with the plain and vanilla Greek yogurts until the mixture is fluffy and smooth.
4. Combine the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Be careful not to over-mix.
5. Use a ladle to add the griddler mixture to the stove pan/griddle. Wait until bubbly and then flip to cook each side. (similar process to making pancakes)
6. Pour remaining 1⁄4 cup of egg whites on the stove pan/griddle in a thin layer. Fry the whole egg as well. Flip once cooked.
7. Plate the griddlers and add a small layer of the egg whites/fried egg to the top
8. Add another griddler to the top to make a sandwich, or leave open-faced.
9. Let cool and enjoy.

## Modifications:
* Use PB2 or peanut butter on the underside of each griddler as a condiment for the sandwich
* Add chopped nuts to the dry ingredients to add a crunchiness 
* Serve without the eggs as a stack of pancakes
* Use all egg whites instead of adding in the whole egg.
