1. Add oats to small pot. Fill with ~1/3-1/2 cup of water (almond milk or milk) or until the top of the oats are covered.
2. Stir in cinnamon and stevia/Truvia, if desired.
3. Turn stove to high heat and let the oats/seasonings mixture heat until the oats start to bubble.
4. Reduce heat to low and stir the oat mixture. This process is similar to cooking oatmeal on the stove.
5. Chop up the apple into cubes. Feel free to remove the peel, if desired. I leave the peel on for extra crunch.
6. Mix in 1/2 of the apples with the oatmeal.
7. Add 1/4 of the apples and 1/2 of the Vanilla Greek Yogurt to the bottom of a heat-safe bowl.
8. The oatmeal/apples mixture is fully cooked when the apples are soft and 80%+ of the water has been absorbed by the oats.
9. Pour the oatmeal/apples mixture into the heat-safe bowl.
10. Top with the remaining 1/4 apples and 1/2 of the Vanilla Greek Yogurt.
11. Sprinkle with cinnamon and stevia/Truvia, if desired.
12. Let cool and enjoy!
