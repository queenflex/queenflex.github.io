This week's meal is a healthy version of a favorite recipe of mine, growing up: Mom's Healthy Meatballs. (Shoutout to my wonderful Mother!) If you're looking for a delicious recipe that's both healthy and easy, look no further. I've combined lean ground beef with diced tomatoes to make a warm, wintery meal suitable for any appetite.

## Ingredients:
* 16oz lean ground beef (I typically buy 93% lean)
* 30g Bothouse Farms Italian Dressing
* 30g Reduced Fat Mexican Cheese
* 1 can Diced Tomatoes - No Salt Added
* Garlic powder, salt, pepper, Italian seasonings

## Tools:
* Large skillet
* 1 bowl
* Kitchen Scale
* Spatula
* Oven dish
* Tongs
* Liquid measuring cup
* Non-stick cooking spray

## Directions:
1.  Mix ground beef, Italian dressing, garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasonings together in a bowl.
2. Weigh out four 4oz portions using the kitchen scale.
3. Divide each 4oz portion into four 1oz portions.
4. Heat a large skillet on high. Spray with non-stick cooking spray and lightly coat the pan with some Italian seasonings.
5. Once the pan is hot, add all of the meatballs to it. Cook the meatballs for roughly 3 minutes each side or until both sides have browned.
6. Preheat oven to 375-deg F.
7. Coat the oven dish with non-stick cooking spray and add half of the can of diced tomatoes to the bottom.
8. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and add to the oven dish.
9. Coat each meatball with the remaining diced tomatoes.
10. Add cheese to the top and additional seasonings, if desired.
11. Bake at 375-deg F for 20-25 minutes or until the meatballs are fully cooked.
12. Let cool for 10 minutes. Pair with a side of spaghetti or veggies and enjoy!
