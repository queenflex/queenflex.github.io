## Ingredients:
* 1500g Sweet Potatoes (I decided to make a large batch to use throughout the week)

## Tools:
* Knife
* Potato Peeler
* Cutting board
* Kitchen Scale
* Spatula
* Non-stick cooking spray
* Oven Mits

## Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375-deg F.
2. Wash and peel the sweet potatoes.
3. Chop each potato into rounds.
4. Line baking sheets with aluminum foil. Spray with non-stick cooking spray. 
5. Add the sweet potatoes to the baking sheets.
6. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, flip, and then bake on the opposite side for another 10 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and let cool before eating. Feel free to add seasonings (garlic, italian seasonings, etc) before the potatoes fully cool. They're so sweet on their own that I like to have them plain :D
