## <u> Method #1:</u>  Wash, Trim, and Season Chicken BEFORE cooking.
Before baking, grilling, frying, or boiling, be sure to wash and trim the chicken. I typically use cold water and a pair of kitchen scissors to trim off extra fat. I recommend these pair of scissors from Walmart. They're very affordable and sharp enough to cut meat. When they're dull, I just buy a new pair. Once you finish washing and trimming the chicken breasts, you are ready to add seasonings or marinades. 

### These are some of my favorite seasonings:
* Garlic powder
* Black pepper
* Organic Italian Seasonings
* Mustard (powder or condiment)
* Red pepper flakes
* Balsamic Vinegar
* Bolthouse Farms Italian Dressing

Be creative with your seasonings. If you are big into BBQ chicken, then find some BBQ marinades or rubs. Just be mindful of the sodium content since some of the seasonings can have high salt contents While sodium is helpful for athletes, too much of anything can cause health problems.

## <u> Method #2: </u>  Flip Once when you Grill Chicken.


My favorite way to cook chicken is on the grill. The chicken is crispy and juicy and usually tastes great even as leftovers! The key to grilling chicken is to have a hot grill (at least 450-deg F) and to flip the chicken breasts once every 10-12 minutes. This allows each side to obtain perfect grill marks and to become both crispy and juicy. Note: depending on the size/weight of the chicken breast, you may need to adjust the time and temperature so that it is fully cooked.


## <u> Method #3:</u>  Set it and forget it. CrockPot Chicken = Shredded Chicken.

If you work a full-time job or are a full-time student without a lot of time to cook chicken, I highly recommend this method. Put two to three chicken breasts in a small CrockPot (8qt), set on high, and then forget it. The chicken will cook through in two to four hours and can be turned or checked every so often. For added flavor, see **Method #1 above:** Wash, trim, and season with your favorite flavors! When the chicken is fully cooked, take two forks and pull the chicken apart for a ready-made-meal in minutes. Sometimes I will use the shredded chicken in other dishes such as my Italian Chicken Lasagna or [Healthy Chicken & Rice Enchiladas from FitMenCook](http://fitmencook.com/fit-healthy-chicken-rice-enchilada-casserole/). It's a super simple way to get a lot of chicken cooked without having to babysit a stove, oven, or grill.
