Charlie Mike. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a terrible name for a child. It&amp;rsquo;s actually the name of a terribly difficult workout program by Ashley Horner and Bodybuilding.com. You&amp;rsquo;re probably reading this because you&amp;rsquo;re curious about starting this program or you found my article posted on Facebook and figured you&amp;rsquo;d give it a read (thank you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;program-overview&#34;&gt;program overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military, &amp;ldquo;Charlie Mike&amp;rdquo; is a command meaning &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Continue Mission.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Each of Horner&amp;rsquo;s workouts is a mini &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; that you have to overcome. The program is 6-weeks long and each week has a theme: week 1 is &amp;ldquo;Try&amp;rdquo;; week 2 is &amp;ldquo;Believe&amp;rdquo;; week 3 is &amp;ldquo;Commit&amp;rdquo;; week 4 is &amp;ldquo;Conquer&amp;rdquo;; week 5 is &amp;ldquo;Earn It&amp;rdquo;; week 6 is &amp;ldquo;Prove it&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t let these themes fool you though. The workouts are tough from the very beginning! &amp;ldquo;Try&amp;rdquo; will certainly become a motif on day 1 of the program. (This is especially true if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a background of low-intensity work). You may even get a few stares from your average gym-goers because they&amp;rsquo;re thinking, &amp;ldquo;dang, what kind of workout is (s)he doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence about doing this program, you should stop thinking about doing it and just dive in. The more you ponder whether or not this routine is for you, the more you will talk yourself out of it. Don&amp;rsquo;t over-analyze the routine. I&amp;rsquo;ll simplify it for you here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each routine follows a similar format: 1 compound exercise followed by 1-2 high-intensity interval circuits and some running/rowing sprinkled in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s the best of both worlds: you get to work your strength while becoming more agile. For me, this program was such a good choice for the summertime because there&amp;rsquo;s something so rewarding about working until you&amp;rsquo;re about to die during the summer months. (Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because when you walk out of the gym as a sweaty mess, you&amp;rsquo;re greeted by the summer sun and all the happy feelings of summer. Plus, there&amp;rsquo;s always the opportunity to hang poolside with a cold one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-m-a-charlie-mike-fan&#34;&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m a Charlie Mike Fan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This program makes you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re training for something that matters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this program, I was stuck in a training rut. I was hitting my typical compound lifts with some accessory work thrown in here and there. While my lifts were progressing, I just felt stale. Training wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly enjoyable because I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was working towards any specific goal. This program provides everything you need in order to feel like you&amp;rsquo;re achieving something ridiculously awesome each training day. Because the program is named after a military command, it made me appreciate those who train this hard all the time in order to protect our nation and our freedom.
The program begins with about a weekâ€™s worth of finding your 1-rep-max (1RM) for the following compound lifts: back squat, front squat, deadlift, bench press, and push press. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a calculator to help you determine the number of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.queenflex.com/p/one-rep-max-1rm-warm-up-calculator.html&#34;&gt;reps per set for a 1RM test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 1RM test, you&amp;rsquo;ll jump right into a few cardio circuits. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what a typical day looks like (strength + conditioning):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GETfCoTJcUA/V7DhHSqYpcI/AAAAAAAABDk/0y4HTrZEpagaqRoE7ZXHVo__7IwVWgWCgCLcB/s1600/charlie-mike-example-day16.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Mike Day 16 from Bodybuilding.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of rest, Horner does a great job at emphasizing proper rest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was over-trained at all during this program; however, I did have to modify some of the routines to accommodate my schedule. After each conditioning circuit, you&amp;rsquo;re told to take 5-10 minutes of rest, which I found to be plenty of time to both recover and to get ready for the next circuit. Some days I needed closer to 10 minutes of rest, while other days I was ready to go in 5. Just be sure to time yourself because time tends to move quickly when you&amp;rsquo;re in &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bonus to this program is that there is a dedicated Charlie Mike App to help track your workouts! It&amp;rsquo;s not an overly complex app, and you can&amp;rsquo;t log data in it; however, it is much better than printing the PDFs off of Bodybuidling.com or trying to view the exercises on the mobile website. I especially liked not having to plan out any routines for the 6-week period. Each day was a different set of exercises, all of which proved to be difficult in their own ways.
Nothing is perfect, that includes Charlie Mike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A downfall to this program is the lack of definitive nutrition plan. I think that nutrition is a major part of any training program; however, Horner did not specify what the macronutrient amounts or percentages should be during this program. This is left to you to figure out. She does recommend eating a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods, which is the standard recommendation in any program. I ate pretty liberally during this program and didn&amp;rsquo;t follow a specific meal plan. Right now though, I am following your typical principles of IIFYM (if it fits your macros) and am eating roughly 40-40-20 (protein-carbs-fat). If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in dialing in your nutrition, this may not be the exact program for you. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend finding a nutrition program or coach to help you figure out your numbers. Nutrition can make or break your performance, so to be successful on this program, you will want to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re eating enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3f3LP2LeNqk/V7DHJIwqgRI/AAAAAAAABCs/CgCnjVp4QBMrtLKNQ3Eyu-vO7sOgT0UEQCLcB/s1600/it-doesnt-get-easier-you-get-better.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; Week 1 was tough. &lt;em&gt;But so was Week 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body was just more adapted to handle the workouts over time.
Charlie Mike was not a breeze. It was just as tough on week 6 as it was on week 1. I found that each workout was progressively more difficult even with an increased work capacity. I was never bored with these routines because once I was warmed up and into my first cardio circuit, the feeling was analogous to a &amp;ldquo;runner&amp;rsquo;s high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far and still aren&amp;rsquo;t convinced this workout is for you, then okay, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not. So for that reason alone, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the reasons why you &lt;u&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/u&gt; try Charlie Mike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want an easy workout routine for a deload or relaxation training cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to focus on strength or hypertrophy or cardio, separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t want to sweat during your workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re starting a cutting diet cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re afraid to step out of your comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re injured. (Seriously, rest up and get better before exercising!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t want to look like a crazy at your globo-gym.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note this isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete list of why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give this a try. Personally, I think if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this far and are on the fence about trying it, you&amp;rsquo;re just looking for excuses. (Lame)
Final Thoughts and Program Rating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Rotten Tomatoes rates movies, here are my ratings for Charlie Mike in the categories of program exercises, schedule, nutrition, recovery, and overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exercises&lt;/strong&gt;  â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  &lt;br&gt;
Charlie Mike has a variety of exercises including your fundamental compound lifts as well as olympic lifts: thrusters, cleans, clean &amp;amp; jerks. Strength and conditioning is included in every workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;schedule&lt;/strong&gt; â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  â˜… &lt;br&gt;
The schedule was pretty easy to follow. Each workout follows the same structure: strength + conditioning circuits. Days can be interchanged as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; â˜…  â˜…  &lt;br&gt;
This program does not provide a specific nutrition program with complete macronutrients or diet recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recovery&lt;/strong&gt; â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  â˜… &lt;br&gt;
There is plenty of recovery time between exercises and between workout days. Like schedule, workouts can be rearranged to accommodate your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;overall&lt;/strong&gt; â˜…  â˜…  â˜…  â˜… &lt;br&gt;
Overall this routine was one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve completed from Bodybuilding.com. I highly recommend trying it if your current routine is stale, or if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to pump up the intensity in your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6-weeks of Charlie Mike, all of my compound lifts have increased in weight. My endurance and my performance have also improved significantly. Charlie Mike was a mentally and physically challenging program, which upon completion made me realize that Iâ€™m a lot stronger than I thought I was. My mission was successfully completed. Now itâ€™s your turn. &lt;em&gt;Are you up for the challenge?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>my perspective on daily undulating periodization (dup)</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/daily-undulating-periodization/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2016 18:30:55 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/daily-undulating-periodization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP) is all the rage these days. For a &amp;ldquo;program hopper&amp;rdquo; like myself, I find that DUP is a great way to feel like you&amp;rsquo;re doing something different each training session, without actually sacrificing progress, strength, or hypertrophy goals. The structure for DUP varies from person-to-person; however, since I am fairly new to this concept of training, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to shed some light and decompose the process of setting up a DUP training program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few things to consider before writing your own DUP program: strength vs. hypertrophy, number of rest days, personal enjoyment exercises, etc. With that said, I have written this article to help you better assess DUP and whether or not it is the right programming style for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me introduce you to my little friend,&amp;rdquo; DUP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I jump right into my process for DUP programming, I&amp;rsquo;d like to briefly explain the principles behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jmaxfitness.com/blog/daily-undulating-periodization/&#34;&gt;Daily Undulating Periodization.&lt;/a&gt; The concept is summarized in rather simple terms: for each training day, the routine includes exercises that are assigned a number of reps (rep scheme). The rep scheme changes each training session over the course of a training period (usually 4-6 weeks). Rep schemes are typically in one of three categories: strength (4-6 reps), hypertrophy (8-12 reps), endurance (15-20 reps). If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to become a more &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; athlete with your training, you may choose to have different rep schemes within the same training session (i.e. exercise 1 for 4 reps, exercise 2 for 8 reps, exercise 3 for 15 reps) or alternate rep schemes throughout a training week. In order to create a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.muscleforlife.com/guide-to-muscle-hypertrophy-muscle-growth/&#34;&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt; using DUP, you must increase volume your volume. Training volume can be increased a number of ways, but my two go-to methods are 1) using an as many reps as possible (AMRAP) set to determine whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re ready to increase the weight the next training week; or 2) increasing the number of sets each week within the training period (weight stays the same through the training period). Ok, so now that you have a brief understanding of DUP, I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a simple methodology to create a DUP training program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-for-daily-undulating-periodization&#34;&gt;programming for daily undulating periodization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;balance: the human body is a complex system, so training routines are meant to be simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-dup-routine-has-four-main-components&#34;&gt;a DUP routine has four main components:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental Exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rep Scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Period Length/Deload Schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fundamental-exercises&#34;&gt;fundamental exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about &amp;ldquo;fundamental exercises&amp;rdquo;, what I really mean are your &amp;ldquo;main lifts&amp;rdquo; or the &lt;strong&gt;compound lifts&lt;/strong&gt; you want to include in your program: squats, bench, deadlifts, presses, and variations of these lifts. What I typically do is pick three compound lifts to work in a training period. For example, my current program includes front squats, barbell bench press, and rack pulls. The goal is to pick the exercises that you need to work. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rep-scheme&#34;&gt;rep scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your exercises picked, you need to decide on
your rep scheme. As I stated in the introduction, you can either train
the same rep scheme for each exercise or have a separate rep scheme for each exercise and rotate them throughout a training week. My current program does the latter and 4, 6, and 10 reps each training day, one rep scheme per exercise (i.e. front squat for 4 reps, bench press for 6 reps, and rack pull for 10 reps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-scheme&#34;&gt;set scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s great, but how many sets should I be doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question depends on how you want to attack progressive overload. The idea is to have as few variables as possible, while still seeing a maximum result [check out this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4hourlife.com/2012/11/26/the-4-hour-chef-finding-the-minimum-effectiv%20e-dose-med-of-life/&#34;&gt;Minimum Effective Dose&lt;/a&gt;]. For the sake of keeping this article concise, I will only touch on two ways to determine your set scheme: keep the number of sets constant throughout the training cycle and increase the weight used for each exercise each week or increase the number of sets each week while keeping the weight used for each exercise constant. Right now my training period is four weeks long; the first week I do 2 sets; second week 3 sets; third week is 4 sets (3 sets + 1 set AMRAP); fourth week is 2 sets or deload. You can follow this pattern as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former method calls for increasing the weight by 5-10 lbs per exercise per week as long as you have achieved all of your sets and reps for each exercise. If you fail your bench press at 225 for 7 reps when you should have gotten 10, then you probably aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to increase the weight for that exercise. The goal is to make progress on your lifts without sacrificing form, mobility, and overall quality of the movement. A good way to test whether or not you are ready to move up in weight is to do an AMRAP set on your last set of the week prior to deload (i.e. for me, on my 3rd week, my fourth set is an AMRAP set). If you beat the number of reps than prescribed for &amp;gt;85% of your training days for each exercise, respectively, then you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go up in weight on the first week of the next training cycle. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about training period length and deloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;period-length-deload-schedule&#34;&gt;period length/deload schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need to decide how long you want your training period to last. A training period can last anywhere from 4-6 or 4-8 weeks, but ultimately depends on your preference, how your body feels with training, and the overall progress you&amp;rsquo;re making. For me, I like to take a deload week on the 4th week of the training cycle by dropping back to 2 sets as I do on week 1. This allows me to recover better and reduces the likelihood that I get burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also follow a 2-days on, 1 day off schedule where the off-day alternates between either a full day of rest/yoga day or an &amp;ldquo;accessory day&amp;rdquo; where I focus on 10-12 isolation movements to help with hypertrophy. For the accessory day, I follow the same set scheme as the week and keep the rep scheme constant at 10-15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/double-stimulation-training&#34;&gt;interesting finding&lt;/a&gt; that says 24 hours after training a muscle group, you have greater ability to increase muscle mass by training it again during that timeframe. This is mainly why I use a 2-day on, 1 day off pattern rather than 5-day on, 2 day off training pattern. I also believe that since you&amp;rsquo;re undulating the rep scheme each day, you have the ability to recover slightly, but also stimulate the muscle enough to continue mass building. I am still playing around with how this works for me personally, but I&amp;rsquo;d be curious to know if any of you have had success with this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-video&#34;&gt;reference video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still slightly confused? Have a look at this video for a visual demonstration of programming for DUP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lessons from stronglifts</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/stronglifts/lessons-from-stronglifts/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2016 13:25:32 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/stronglifts/lessons-from-stronglifts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just say StrongLifts and I have a &lt;strong&gt;LOVE-HATE&lt;/strong&gt; relationship these past 2 weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some major strength gains for bench press (up to 110# 5X5); however, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce the volume of my deadlifts and barbell rows due to low back fatigue and stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;15&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sIsl0t4PpBg/VpvVMDXm_4I/AAAAAAAAA6A/1VZUrfJ7IPA/s1600/a%2Bqueenflex.blogspot.com%2Breview.jpg&#34; width=&#34;70%&#34; height=&#34;20%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this program is very strenuous on the body and ample recovery is necessary in order to progress by at least 5 lbs each session. I also have never continuously followed a &amp;ldquo;strength building&amp;rdquo; program, where increased volume is a priority. I honestly can say that I LOVE this way of training because it forces you to give everything you&amp;rsquo;ve got and leaves you feeling extremely &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s an addictive feeling, and I&amp;rsquo;m growing to love every training session just a little more. It&amp;rsquo;s become more about ME vs. ME as opposed to  ME vs everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s pause a moment and discuss appropriate nutrition for StrongLifts 5X5. You must eat on this program. Let me repeat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU MUST EAT ON THIS PROGRAM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not fuel yourself appropriately for these workouts, you will not be able to give the lifts 100% effort. You&amp;rsquo;ll pretty much feel like crap and want to writher up and die. Now that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration; however, YOU MUST EAT if you want to hit PR&amp;rsquo;s and advance your lifts. To do this, it&amp;rsquo;s very suitable to load carbohydrates around your workout. &lt;a href=&#34;http://staging.eattoperform.com/2013/06/20/eight-nutrition-tips/&#34;&gt;2:1 carbohydrates-protein ratio is fine&lt;/a&gt;. I typically have my pre-workout meal about an hour to an hour and a half prior to lifting. My post-workout meal (PWO) is directly after I cool down/stretch and consists of 2:1 fast-digesting carbs (sugars) to fast absorption whey protein isolate. I am also working to become more consistent with taking &lt;a href=&#34;https://examine.com/supplements/Creatine/&#34;&gt;5g of Creatine Monohydrate&lt;/a&gt; PWO to help with muscle recovery and carbohydrate absorption. For an example of a typical day-in-the-life of Liz, check out my MyFitnessPal diary, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/stronglizlifts?date=2016-01-16&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider when doing any sort of strength building program is recovery. You must allocate rest days on this program. Again, let me repeat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU MUST RECOVER ON THIS PROGRAM. DO NOT CUT REST DAYS!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery days are CRITICAL on this program. If you never rest, you&amp;rsquo;ll never recover, and therefore, you&amp;rsquo;ll never feel &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; to increase your lifts. You&amp;rsquo;ll be in a continual state of soreness, and trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s not fun. Give yourself extra days to recover if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling worn out. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel better and be mentally ready to give it your all in the gym. Remember, heavy, high-volume workouts are tearing your body down. You need time to allow your body to fix the tears and build new tissues and blood vessels to support muscle growth. &lt;strong&gt;Do yourself a favor and rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All and all, StrongLifts has given me a platform to start off my strength training and a flexible plan to meet my weight training goals. I highly recommend jumping in and giving it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>stronglifts results: strength and muscle growth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks on the StrongLifts program have been both rewarding and extremely challenging. Between Christmas, New Years, and traveling with family, as well as keeping up with my Eat To Perform numbers, I added about 20 lbs to my Squat and hit PRs on DeadLifts and Bench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each workout is increasingly difficult and recovery and pre-workout nutrition are key to having successful sessions. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say I finished 2015 with a bang, and certainly look forward to the remaining two-thirds of the StrongLifts [starter] program. I plan to reassess my goals and progress in early March to determine whether or not I want to continue StrongLifts for another cycle or to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-njamapHPYGg/Voc8zbOX2UI/AAAAAAAAA3o/1irFK5yhA9U/s1600/STRONGLIFTS%2B5X5-2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;today-s-workout-day-a-squat-bench-row&#34;&gt;today&amp;rsquo;s workout - day a: squat, bench, row&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lifts today; however, were slightly off, ringing in the new year with a less-than-perfect workout. I missed all my working sets 5X5 for Squats and Rows due to lower back instability and fuzziness. Instead I hit a PR on bench for 5X5 and proceeded to work on my posterior chain mobility and flexibility. Some of my favorite mobility workouts are from Kelly Starrett of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobilitywod.com/&#34;&gt;mobilityWod&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi099DokYrKAhVPxGMKHfezDmAQtwIIIDAB&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJBHzXF-mVjY&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHaLWLA1UMVOUFEO6OzZqgok1GmKw&amp;amp;sig2=vz_aHpCAV1Y7K4uGt-dXpw&#34;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq3O6AkorKAhVY-2MKHVVdBakQtwIIHzAB&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzT657soclws&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHiOQ9WoMXXQvfBqAiBtEImgna-mg&amp;amp;sig2=oC2AOgiSS_Ap2C-7dvP-Dw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.110151844,d.cGc&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; are my go-to&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m having lower back instability or hip tightness. I highly recommend checking out the mobility project for improving overall mobility and health while building strength and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;next steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to give myself the weekend off and start back up on Monday (1/4/16) with Day B. While a disappointing start to the new year, I am very happy with my overall progress on this program and have never been more excited to work out. Even though the exercises are the same, each routine feels different because it is all about trying to increase volume through an increase in weight over 5 sets of 5. I have no doubt that I will be on my way to hitting 225# squat and deadlift and 145# bench in 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There it is. Short and sweet. Until the next update&amp;hellip; Lift Heavy, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hi@queenflex.com&#34;&gt;-QFB.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>stronglifts training overview &amp; guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the StrongLifts 5x5 program. For those of you unfamiliar with the training plan, it&amp;rsquo;s very simple and most workouts take an hour or less to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview-of-stronglifts-5x5&#34;&gt;overview of stronglifts 5X5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-npDASfZJi1s/VnWXXfQvKtI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/n-Jb0SKgxvc/s1600/SL5x5_1%25262.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are two types of days for this program: Day A and Day B. The 5 exercises this program includes are Squats, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Rows, and Deadlifts. Each exercise is done for 5 sets of 5 reps with the exception of Deadlifts (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain that further in a moment). See the graphic below for the exercises and routine schedule for Day A and Day B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you will want to do more on this program because it seems so simple. Do not do extra sets or reps or additional exercises! This is a 12-week + strength building program that forces progressive overload by increasing the weight by 2.5 - 5 lbs each day. You will burn yourself out if you add in additional work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;center&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s47R91gqxX8/VnWl1J_iZ9I/AAAAAAAAA1s/Fj-epoNRI8E/s1600/5_5.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternating-workouts-days-a-and-b&#34;&gt;alternating workouts days a and b&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical schedule on StrongLifts 5x5 is set up alternating Days A and B. For example, the first week of the program goes A, B, A with at least 1 day of rest between each workout day. My first week was Thursday (Day A), Saturday (Day B), Monday (Day A). On the right, I have included the calendar of my workouts for the first two weeks of the program. I highly recommend using the StrongLifts App to help track your workouts and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wpwu3F2Juac/VnWfxuq3ctI/AAAAAAAAA1c/XgWeBZExexE/s1600/dec_calendar.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;15%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;progress-weeks-1-2&#34;&gt;progress weeks 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Week 1 started off pretty slow, and I was very skeptical that my body could handle squatting 3x/week, Week 2 proved to me that this program is going to be awesome! So if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting off, give it at least 5 sessions to make your initial judgement. I especially like how the StrongLifts app has a timer to keep the sets going at an appropriate pace; after each set, once you log it, the app will tell you to take 90 seconds of rest if the set was easy or 3 minutes rest if it was challenging. If you missed any reps, it will tell you to take 5 minutes rest and provide encouragement that you will make all 5 reps the next set. Pretty great if you ask me! Below is the graph generated by the StrongLifts app for all 5 of my core lifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;15&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FgZSU473vMI/VnWfgHoYiJI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/b6ZnN_y6qhk/s1600/FullSizeRender.jpg&#34; width=&#34;35%&#34; height=&#34;15%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead press is in purple; Bench is in gray; Barbell row is orange; Squats are in blue; and deadlifts are in green. Not too bad for 5 sessions. My goal is to crush 200 lbs in the 12 weeks of the StrongLifts program. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty static in terms of progression these last two years; however, 2016 will be my year to change it up and #MakeItCount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-brief-rant-about-nutrition&#34;&gt;a brief rant about nutrition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, with any strength training program, be sure you&amp;rsquo;re eating enough! Do not try to be in a caloric deficit or on a fat-burning program during StrongLifts. You will need the fuel (carbs!) to get through all your sets and progress. For someone who has always had the &amp;ldquo;diet-mind,&amp;rdquo; it will be tough to bump up the calories and eat more; however, if you want to feel good in the gym, become a better athlete, and recover at an optimal level, you must eat to perform. No this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean eat crap or junk food all day. It means making healthy choices and having a balance of all the macronutrient groups (proteins, carbs, fats). Personally, my ratios have been around 50% Carbs, 30% Protein, and 20% fats. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of food for someone who has been eating around BMR (bad idea, don&amp;rsquo;t do this); however, almost immediately after increasing my intake and upping my carbs, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt more refreshed, and more mentally focused on hitting new PR&amp;rsquo;s each session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweet &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/lizmillerfit&#34;&gt;@lizmillerfit&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions about my progress or my opinions about the program. Until next review&amp;hellip;Stay Fit. Stay Strong. &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hi@queenflex.com&#34;&gt;-QFB.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>build muscle with stronglifts 5X5</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So typically I like to plan out my routines and schedule what, when, and why I&amp;rsquo;m training and eating a certain way. In this case; however, I decided to jump head-first into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stronglifts.com/&#34;&gt;StrongLifts 5X5&lt;/a&gt; because, frankly, I&amp;rsquo;m tired of dancing around the bush with fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2EtzjoI-4ro/VmuoW5hWaLI/AAAAAAAAAzM/04pZQJxEQFU/s1600/is%2Bit%2Bin%2Byou%253F%2523makeitcount-2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;85%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next 12 weeks I will be training according to the StrongLifts 5X5 program and continuing to Eat To Perform. My 2016 goals include considerable strength gains, so to FINALLY meet these goals, I am going to give this 5X5 program a try. You can find my StrongLifts updates here. I will work in real-time so that you can see first-hand how good-bad-ugly this program ends up being. With that said, I am using this article to introduce the first Strategy in the #MAKEITCOUNT series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-1-accountability-everyone-wants-to-say-they-did-it-without-actually-doing-it&#34;&gt;strategy #1 accountability: everyone wants to say they did it, without actually doing it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be that person who commits to something and then fails to actually follow through with it. Now I understand some situations are circumstantial, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it, who likes excuses? Not me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I will be spending the early part of winter working on my strength with StrongLifts 5X5, what will you be doing? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s starting to workout for the first time in ten years; maybe your goal is to start flossing twice a day (dental hygiene is important); maybe you&amp;rsquo;re starting a new job and your goal is to save for retirement; whatever your 2016 goals are, you have to jump all in and go for them. Challenge yourself to do something every day to work towards your goal. 2% changes each day add up to major improvements over the course of weeks, months, and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Strategy #2&amp;hellip; #MAKEITCOUNT. Learn to become Accountable&lt;/p&gt;
