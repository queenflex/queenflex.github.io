      <description>&lt;p&gt;The holidays are quickly approaching, and this week&amp;rsquo;s training schedule has been very sporadic. While I missed two training sessions (Wednesday and Thursday), I am hitting deadlifts today! The fitness lifestyle has to be dynamic, and you have to be both accountable, committed, and flexible. If you&amp;rsquo;re in it for the long-haul, this is an important consideration to have, so that you aren&amp;rsquo;t frustrated with yourself when life tends to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;9-20am-dec-23&#34;&gt;9:20am | Dec 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been awake for about two hours now&amp;hellip;cleaning up the blog and developing content for this post. As I said in the article preview, I missed a few training sessions this week. Since I can&amp;rsquo;t go backwards, I plan on getting to the gym around &lt;del&gt;10:30am&lt;/del&gt; 1:30pm for a deadlift session at the Hartford YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;deadlift session&lt;/strong&gt; is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;warm-up&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/warm-up-routine/&#34;&gt;my warm-up routine&lt;/a&gt;, then deadlifts at
95 x 5 | 120 x 5 | 145 x 3 |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;5/3/1&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
170 x 3 | 190 x 3 | 215 x 3+ |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;boring but big&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
deadlifts: 5 x 10 at 120 &lt;br&gt;
hanging leg raises: 5 x 10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who may not know, I have my own set of warm-up exercises I like to perform prior to the barbell warm-up sets. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a separate post on this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/warm-up-routine/&#34;&gt;warm-up routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as well as my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/ten-minute-routine/&#34;&gt;10-minute cool-down routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. While warming up and cooling down are &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo;, they are necessary to a successful training program. Warm-ups routines, when designed and executed properly, prevent injuries. Cool-down routines, promote recovery. Over time, injury prevention and proper recovery will help you get to the next level with your training. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;So just do them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;11-30am-dec-23&#34;&gt;11:30am | Dec 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goal-setting-and-a-look-at-2017&#34;&gt;goal-setting and a look at 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to get sidetracked or distracted while I&amp;rsquo;m on a training program. That is why in 2017 I want to focus on being more mindful and living in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1: Do a little &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; planning of the future, and a little &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;commitment to now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also want to take my strength and hypertrophy training to the next level. By that, I want to achieve &amp;ldquo;elite&amp;rdquo; for all of the &amp;ldquo;big 4&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#2: Hit the &amp;ldquo;elite&amp;rdquo; weight targets for my current weight. At a bodyweight of ~150 lb, this means a 1RM of 168 lb for bench, 237 lb for squat, 303 lb for deadlift, and 100 lb for overhead press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mar 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bench: 130 | Squat: 185 | Deadlift: 245 | Press: 70 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bench: 145 | Squat: 205 | Deadlift: 260 | Press: 80 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bench: 158 | Squat: 225 | Deadlift: 280 | Press: 90 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dec 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bench: 168 | Squat: 237 | Deadlift: 303 | Press: 100 &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body recomposition/fat loss always makes my list. I think the biggest reason why it&amp;rsquo;s been an &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo; goal for all these years, is my lack of consistency with diet and lack of programming my nutrition to complement my training goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3. This year, I want to work on being &lt;strong&gt;more consistent&lt;/strong&gt; with my nutrition and &lt;em&gt;train to match my goals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the &lt;strong&gt;first half of 2016&lt;/strong&gt; will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January: finish up 5/3/1 (strength block)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February - March: body recomp (blended hypertrophy-strength)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April - June: Cut for 10-12 weeks (hypertrophy training)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to start cutting in January, I think it&amp;rsquo;s too soon to do so. I&amp;rsquo;d rather wait and put more weight on my lifts and start cutting early spring. Then if I decide I want to continue cutting in July (make it a 16 week cut), I&amp;rsquo;ll have the added time to do so. (Somehow cutting and summertime go hand-in-hand, so why not?) Plus, this go-around, I want to end up being ~18% and down about 15-20lbs (~130-135). Ideally, I want to set up a quicker, 8-10 week cut, and that&amp;rsquo;s certainly a possibility down the road, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll factor in 10-12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-training-more-food&#34;&gt;food, training, more food&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pre-workout-nutrition&#34;&gt;pre-workout nutrition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I planned to train fasted today (and I like training fasted), I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to the gym for 10:30am, and my stomach was very grumbly around 11am. Today&amp;rsquo;s pre-workout meal consisted of 5g of ON Gold Standard BCAA&amp;rsquo;s and a bowl of 1c. cinnamon chex with ~5oz of plain greek yogurt, 8g natural peanut butter, and 1/4c. unsweetened vanilla almond milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hitting-deadlifts-at-my-old-gym&#34;&gt;hitting deadlifts at my old gym&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Downtown Hartford YMCA brings back a lot of lifting/fitness memories. It&amp;rsquo;s where I had horrible back pain, some of my heaviest deadlifts, and good workouts with good people. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was able to hit deadlifts there today. &lt;strong&gt;PSA: I hit 215 for 3!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-smile-o&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Even though it felt &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo;, I think I need to get used to holding &amp;ldquo;heavier&amp;rdquo; weights. That&amp;rsquo;ll come with time and strategic training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-50pm-dec-23&#34;&gt;6:50pm | Dec 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-workout-nutrition&#34;&gt;post-workout nutrition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; fan of supplements because most of them are unnecessary and expensive; however, you can read my &lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/supplement-guide/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;mini guide on supplementation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to help determine which supplements might be beneficial for you. Typically, I will take 5g of creatine, 3g of fish oil, and 5000iu of vitamin D post-workout, &lt;em&gt;if I remember&lt;/em&gt;. Which lately, hasn&amp;rsquo;t been happening. I know this year I&amp;rsquo;m stressing consistency, so I&amp;rsquo;ll add that to my list of things to be more consistent with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deadlifts, I like to eat &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of calories (anywhere from 450-800 calories). Mostly because I trained fasted, but also because it tends to be later in the day, and it&amp;rsquo;s much harder for me to eat 1000&amp;rsquo;s of calories after 4pm. So why not?! Today I made a bowl of cream of rice with vanilla greek yogurt, peanut butter, and marshmellow fluff. Pretty odd combo, but it tastes great! For dinner, we had haddock, sweet &amp;amp; white potatoes, and veggies. I plan to eat some more food pre-bed, just to top off my protein and carb macros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate you sticking through this longer article. I will be back tomorrow with a post on my &amp;ldquo;ab routine&amp;rdquo; and some training progress updates. The goal is to hit bench press to catch up from the week I missed while I was sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come on this 5/3/1 journey&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hi@queenflex.com&#34;&gt;-QFB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      <title>tried and true warm-up routine</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/warm-up-routine/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 14:40:17 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/warm-up-routine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never really had a &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; warm-up routine until I struggled to come back to the sport of lifting after a lower-back injury. Had I properly warmed up prior to lifting each session, I might not have suffered the injury in the first place. I treat warm-up routines as a method of injury prevention and will not start the warm-up sets with a barbell until I feel completely warm and ready to lift - both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article outlines my 10-15 minute warm-up routine that I like to perform before any of my compound lifts (squat, bench, press, deadlift). There are some slight variations depending on the movement I am performing, but at the heart of the routine are four key movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I jump into outlining the routine, I want to explain a few principles of what and why I picked certain movements. The exercises given below are a combination of my lower-back rehabilitation program as well as functional movements to help promote the proper motor patterns prior to performing a key lift with weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that if my muscles are warmed up and my body has performed the movement with bodyweight or lighter weights, I am not as worried or concerned to go heavier because I&amp;rsquo;ve already activated the targeted muscle group and practiced proper form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exercises are performed for as many reps and sets as needed depending on how I feel. So if I feel especially stiff or sore in a particular area, I may spend more time warming up. That&amp;rsquo;s the neat thing about warm-ups, you&amp;rsquo;re warming up for &lt;em&gt;that particular session&lt;/em&gt;, so be sure to listen to your body and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting what you need to have a successful training day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;queenflex-warm-up-routine&#34;&gt;queenflex warm-up routine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;u&gt;Shoulder Dislocation Mobility Drill&lt;/u&gt;: grab a band or a pipe and perform 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/02HdChcpyBs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;u&gt;Kettlebell Bottoms-Up Carry&lt;/u&gt;: grab a 15-25lb kettlebell and perform 2-4 sets of 50-100 ft walks per arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpBzi0HIdAI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;u&gt;Kettlebell Arm Bar &lt;/u&gt;:  grab a 15-25lb kettlebell and perform 1-2 sets of 10 reps per arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHVBrsysBUY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;u&gt; Back Extensions&lt;/u&gt;: (weighted or bodyweight) I like to do 2 sets of 12 reps of the weighted back extensions (machine or plate) as well as 2 sets of 12 standing back extensions. Some days I may even throw in a third round of bodyweight back extensions on the back extension bench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standing:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xqz_S7Znh9g&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back Extension Machine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ab0eIyp9CWQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back Extension Bench:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315px&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vx0jZBEmZcE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;u&gt; Dumbbell Sumo Deadlift &lt;/u&gt;: I like to perform these movements on squat and deadlift days to help activate the glutes. Perform 2-3 sets of 10 reps with a 50-75lb dumbbell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vr8yOR_YwXg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before deadlifts or squats, I will throw in a few sets of kneeling leg curls to warm up my hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is relatively short, but as I said above, if I feel tightness in a particular muscle group or bodypart, I will pick a movement and perform a few sets to warm-up that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things easier for you, I&amp;rsquo;ve included a printable version of this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/2hjXHJD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here for the printable version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>lifts, food, travels</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/life-on-531/lifts-food-travels/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 08:55:15 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/life-on-531/lifts-food-travels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week has flown by, and I promise you, I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgotten about the &amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1&amp;rdquo; series. This is going to be a bit of a longer article recapping my week, some travel, workouts, and food (because, who could forget talking about what they eat during a training program?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just jump to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what happened. It&amp;rsquo;s like I woke up and did a bunch of things, but can&amp;rsquo;t really remember what I did or when I did it. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of how life goes between travelling, working 10+ hour shifts, and of course, the HOLIDAYS! Did I mention we&amp;rsquo;re 5 days out from Christmas?! How did that happen? 2016 was so short-lived. Anyone else feel like we aren&amp;rsquo;t ready for 2017?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing my talk about last week&amp;hellip;let&amp;rsquo;s talk first about training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-3-1-training-progress&#34;&gt;5/3/1 training progress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to meet my training plans as mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/article-3_5-3-1/&#34;&gt;Article 3 - real talk in the real life&lt;/a&gt;, which is awesome considering I just came off a brief cold. Squats still feel &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; for me, and as I start to think about my fitness purpose for 2017, I definitely want to make sure I include Squat form and strength to the list of things to accomplish. Saturday morning deadlifts were on point, and I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to this weekend&amp;rsquo;s session (back to the good ole Hartford YMCA!). The only sad part about Saturday morning deadlifts is the fact that I am no longer having waffles as part of the post-workout routine. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/post/article-1_5-3-1/&#34;&gt;You can read more about my efforts in going Gluten Free in the first article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt; Spoiler Alert:&lt;/u&gt; so far mission Gluten Free has been a &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My skin is still acne-ridden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My digestion is all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I&amp;rsquo;m still going to continue being Gluten Free for another few months, with the hope that my skin and digestive problems will clear up over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-week-s-training-schedule&#34;&gt;this week&amp;rsquo;s training schedule&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to travel Sunday - Tuesday my workouts have been rearranged this week. I&amp;rsquo;m also feeling a spur of mid-to-upper back/low neck stiffness, which is usually a sign that I need to rest and stretch out my neck and shoulders. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that will resolve itself in a few days, as it&amp;rsquo;s pretty gnarly trying to move or &amp;ldquo;crane&amp;rdquo; my neck in multiple directions. (You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how often you do this in a given day!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what my estimated training plan is for this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun - &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; / travelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mon - &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; / travelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tues - &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; / travelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wed - Squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thurs - Military Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fri - Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sat - Bench (pending an open gym on Dec 24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun - HIIT/Abs at home (Christmas Day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-look-at-my-lifting-progress-2016&#34;&gt;a look at my lifting progress (2016)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who follow this blog know that I am a HUGE fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://queenflex.github.io/links#strongapp&#34;&gt;Strong App&lt;/a&gt;. I just want to take a moment and share with you the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made on my estimated 1RM for the big 4 during 2016. All weights are measured in pounds, below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t emphasize how much &lt;u&gt; tracking&lt;/u&gt; helps with making &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you&amp;rsquo;re starting, how will you know where you&amp;rsquo;re going?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the Strong App, let me know what you think, and make that effort to log all your workouts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-enough-said&#34;&gt;FOOD. &lt;em&gt;enough said&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday and Saturday were packing and prepare for travel days. Sunday through today (Tuesday) were travel across the U.S. (First a short trip to Texas, then to Connecticut to spend time with family.) Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that my diet was far from perfect. Something I want to emphasize here is a common notion of &amp;ldquo;under-eating&amp;rdquo;. When you&amp;rsquo;re on an IIFYM diet, it&amp;rsquo;s really important to actually &lt;u&gt;hit&lt;/u&gt; the macros: not more, not less, but as close to the numbers as possible. Chronically under-eating is certainly a problem I pick up periodically due to shifts in my lifestyle. (The busier I tend to be, the easier it is for me to &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to eat or &amp;ldquo;under-eat&amp;rdquo;.) It&amp;rsquo;s a habit I need to work on breaking, which is why I&amp;rsquo;m going to provide some tips as to how to hit your macros while constantly on-the-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a brief commentary about airport foods and restaurants, and then shift gears to travelling with already prepared food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;buy-this-food-at-the-airport&#34;&gt;buy &lt;strong&gt;[this]&lt;/strong&gt; food at the airport&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often easier and more expensive to buy food at the airport rather than bringing it. If you have the financial means to pick something up at the airport, I personally recommend it, for convenience and food safety purposes. &lt;em&gt;(There&amp;rsquo;s nothing worse than trying to eat that smelly, warm chicken that&amp;rsquo;s been mushed in your bag while you&amp;rsquo;re traveling.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas for food choices while you&amp;rsquo;re at the airport. Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s all about hitting your macros, so if it fits, go ahead and eat it. And these tips are most applicable to short-haul flights and not your 8+ hour trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve linked the nutritional information to the restaurant/food name to give you an idea of the calories and macros for each item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;foods&#34;&gt;foods&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/subway-double-chicken-chopped-salad-all-veggies-no-cheese-dressing-350179610&#34;&gt;Subway | Chopped Salad Double Chicken&lt;/a&gt;: Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating gluten-free for the past few weeks, I like getting their chopped salad with double chicken and spicy brown mustard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fatsecret.com/Diary.aspx?pa=fjrd&amp;amp;rid=896256&#34;&gt;Pinkberry | Original Tart Yogurt Small&lt;/a&gt;: I always seem to get dehydrated while traveling, so something about this frozen original tart makes me feel refreshed without feeling stuffed. Other than the high sugar content, fro-yo is something I&amp;rsquo;ll occasionally get if it&amp;rsquo;s later in the day, and I have some carb macros to play with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1809/2&#34;&gt;Any newstand | Fruit: Apples, Bananas&lt;/a&gt;: For shelf-life and longevity, I like getting apples over bananas, but for a quick snack, a banana is a great choice as well. These are great choices for boosting your micronutrients as well as fiber for the day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/nutrition-facts-calories/quest-bar&#34;&gt;Any newstand | QuestBar/Protein Bars&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of protein bars and shakes because I don&amp;rsquo;t find them to taste overly good nor are they overly filling. But if cost is a problem and you want a quick snack, this will do!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;drinks&#34;&gt;drinks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always dehydrated while I travel, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be sure you pick up a bottle of water and drink it throughout the day! Since you can&amp;rsquo;t bring liquids through airport security, you can either purchase a bottle once you pass the TSA screening, or you can bring an empty waterbottle and have it filled up by a restaurant, bar, fast food place, or water fountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/zero-ultra-white-monster-energy-drink-drink-378945313?v2=false&#34;&gt;Any newstand | White Monster Energy Zero&lt;/a&gt;: If I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling a hot coffee, I&amp;rsquo;ll grab a cold Monster for the caffeine, and because they taste good! They&amp;rsquo;re relatively expensive at the airport, but I figure the can has two servings and a tall coffee from Starbucks is about the same price per serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/starbucks/sugar-free-mocha-syrup&#34;&gt;Starbucks | Tall Dark Roast with 2 pumps of SF Mocha&lt;/a&gt;: I wasn&amp;rsquo;t usually a &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; Starbucks drink person, but this one has become a travel favorite because it tastes like hot chocolate with coffee and has all the flavor without all the calories. I&amp;rsquo;ve linked you to the SF Mocha nutrition facts, which for two pumps is about 10 calories! Not too shabby! But of course, if you have the macros to &lt;em&gt;spend&lt;/em&gt;, by all means get a higher caloric drink. &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-smile-o&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;if-you-re-going-to-meal-prep-before-travelling-this-is-what-you-should-do&#34;&gt;if you&amp;rsquo;re going to meal-prep before travelling, this is what you should do&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook up a batch of protein (chicken, beef) and a batch of carbs (rice, pasta, etc.) and store them in large zip baggies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pack yourself one or two tupperware with lids and cutlery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pack some napkins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store inside of a cooler or bag with a small, TSA-approved ice pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be sure to call your hotel ahead of time to request a refrigerator and microwave within your room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is best performed if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be gone for a certain period of time that you know you need to have meals pre-made or if you&amp;rsquo;re on a prep where all your food has to be accounted for. With all the different restaurants and grocery stores available, it&amp;rsquo;s almost too easy to buy food when you arrive at your destination and make food within your hotel room. Some of my staples for in-room cooking with a microwave are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;carbs:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oatmeal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minute rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cream of rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;microwavable frozen veggies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;microwavable frozen bagels, waffles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fruits: apples, bananas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;proteins:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greek yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protein powders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precooked chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frozen chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;fats:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cashews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peanut butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your room includes breakfast, there&amp;rsquo;s often cereals, hard boiled eggs, and scrambled eggs! IIFYM is supposed to be a simpler way of maintaining a healthier lifestyle. Don&amp;rsquo;t over-complicate things by avoiding certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consider this the written version of Jake Owen&amp;rsquo;s, &lt;em&gt;Real Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever have one of those days where you&amp;rsquo;re like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;what just happened?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;where&amp;rsquo;s the undo button, ctrl-z!!!!?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Well, today was pretty much that for me. And while my nutrition and my lifting hasn&amp;rsquo;t been on point for any sort of regulated training program, I am still going to continue this series and make up for this &lt;strong&gt;[awful]&lt;/strong&gt; first week of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe align = &#34;right&#34; hspace = &#34;20&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-a4ttJnbBk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpt from &lt;em&gt;Real Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fall real hard, shake off the dirt&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pray to God, let&amp;rsquo;s make a deal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I guess it just got real&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We get real low, we get real high&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It ain&amp;rsquo;t all good, baby, but it&amp;rsquo;s alright&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Real life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-dec-11&#34;&gt;sunday, dec 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday, even though I was feeling better, I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t my usual, healthy self, so I missed my 5/3/1 deadlift workout. &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-frown-o&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; This is real life, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say what did happen when it didn&amp;rsquo;t, or what should have happened on some sort of ideal journey. No excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;20&#34; src=&#34;https://media.makeameme.org/created/guess-what-day-12xlpu.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; height=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s really unfortunate because I have grown to really &lt;u&gt;love&lt;/u&gt; deadlifts, so missing yesterday&amp;rsquo;s session was a bummer. I planned on making up the session today, but it just didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. I woke up at about 9am, had some coffee, got back in bed, and then woke up at 2:30pm like &lt;em&gt;WHAT?!&lt;/em&gt;. So that&amp;rsquo;s how my day went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here with you guys writing this up and watching the Packers crush the Seahawks, while listening to Jake Owen&amp;rsquo;s, &lt;em&gt;Real Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;moving-forward&#34;&gt;moving forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can&amp;rsquo;t go backwards, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about this upcoming week.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Monday (tomorrow)&lt;/u&gt;, I have a rest day scheduled, but if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling well after work, I plan to do a 20 minute Ab workout followed by a 20 minute HIIT session. If not, then I will go home and rest. Nothing like capitalizing on the extra scheduled day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tuesday&lt;/u&gt;, I hit squats! Looks to be pretty similar to last week&amp;rsquo;s split, with the working-set weight at 100 x 3, 115 x 3, and 130 at 3+. My goal is to hit about 15 squats at 130. Following the 5/3/1 squats, I will perform squats for 5 sets of 10 at 70 lbs and then Leg Curls for 5 sets of 10. I will end my workout with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://queenflex.com/post/ten-minute-routine/&#34;&gt;10-minute cool-down routine&lt;/a&gt; and call it a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wednesday&lt;/u&gt;, I have week 2&amp;rsquo;s military press routine, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;center&#34; hspace=&#34;30&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NLy6s4hTA_w/WE3oWpTVGYI/AAAAAAAADXg/lAGygOu-3hkQZENbQRaoHxmK3_Ym7WlOgCLcB/s1600/military-press-week2.png&#34; width=&#34;25%&#34; height=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Screenshot courtesy of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.strengthstandards.co&#34;&gt;Strength Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning to use just the barbell (45 lbs) for the accessory 5 x 10, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier, and just more realistic for functional purposes.  My chin-ups need some serious work, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been managing to hit about 10 sets of 5 reps. (Got to start somewhere!). Last week after hitting all 10 sets of chin-ups, I thought my shoulders were going to fall off, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that much volume is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; necessary to get better at chins. I may switch to assisted chin-ups for 5 sets of 10 just to reduce the post-workout soreness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thursday&lt;/u&gt; is an &amp;ldquo;optional&amp;rdquo; workout day for HIIT and Abs. I will plan to document my HIIT and Abs workouts sometime this week so you have a better understanding of the types of exercises I like to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;/u&gt; are bench and deadlifts, respectively, and since I missed a 5/3/1 chest and deadlift workout from last Friday and Saturday, I will be completing those workouts using the planned numbers from last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come about the end of this week, as we get closer to those days, but there&amp;rsquo;s just an example of what&amp;rsquo;s to come in this &amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1 series.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Article 2 of the &amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1&amp;rdquo; series is brought to you by legs day. You don&amp;rsquo;t know squat, if you don&amp;rsquo;t squat! This article takes a step into my day, my workout, and my nutrition. Click to read more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rise-and-grind-it-s-legs-day-dec-6&#34;&gt;rise and grind, it&amp;rsquo;s legs day! - Dec 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, today was an early start. I woke up at about 5:10am for a 6am shift start. I arrived into the office and was able to grind out a lot of logistics for various projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. And, it turns out I will be heading to Las Vegas in a MONTH for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ces.tech/&#34;&gt;Consumer Electronics Show (CES)&lt;/a&gt;! Tonight, I have a squat workout scheduled and as you may or may not know, I have a love-hate relationship with squats. While I think squats are key to having a solid and functional fitness foundation, form is critical to being able to move a lot of weight. I am still trying to perfect my squat form, and it&amp;rsquo;s been challenging returning to a &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo; squat from a lower-back injury. Ever since sustaining the initial injury, my squats have taken a toll in terms of how much weight I can actually tollerate. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that 5/3/1 will help me take a few steps back, adjust my form, my breathing, and my technique, and ultimately allow me to get stronger. I thing the higher-volume nature of &amp;ldquo;Boring but Big&amp;rdquo; is just what I need to get confident and comfortable with performing the squatting movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trying-so-hard-to-hit-those-macros&#34;&gt;trying so hard to hit those macros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk nutrition for a little bit. I mentioned yesterday how difficult it&amp;rsquo;s been for me to hit my macros (155 protein, 250 carbs, 47 fats), lately. If you had asked me a year ago, I&amp;rsquo;d be able to hit those numbers at 3PM if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t careful. So I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what&amp;rsquo;s up. My appetite has disappeared! Tracking my food has seemed to help, because no matter what I want to eat, it fits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gluten-free diet has been really great so far in terms of how I feel and how I&amp;rsquo;ve been digesting. I haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed too many changes with my skin, but it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure it takes time. The downfall with being gluten-free is that I feel so limited with what I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; eat. It&amp;rsquo;s a choice to eat this way, and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it because I think I&amp;rsquo;ll have a greater health benefit long-term. I just think I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to find other carbohydrates that are gluten-free and low in sugar (&lt;em&gt;good luck&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some foods that are becoming staples to my diet right now are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blueberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strawberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chex/GF cereal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almond milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek Yogurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown Rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Beans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lean ground beef (90-96% lean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whey Protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corn tortillas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% dark chocolate chips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; salad mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pickles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to mix it up and have a bit more variety, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to be limited when it comes to staying gluten-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health-and-feeling-under-the-weather-dec-7-and-8&#34;&gt;health and feeling &amp;ldquo;under the weather&amp;rdquo; - Dec 7 and 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last article I spoke a lot about how &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; this routine was going to be. Unfortunately, that was before I got sick. So these past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling off a headcold, therefore, I didn&amp;rsquo;t train on Wednesday or Thursday. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that I will get back to the gym on Friday for Bench Press, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to depend on how I feel and how much food I&amp;rsquo;m eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/home?status=Life always throws a monkey-wrench. Just when you think everything is going to go your way, something changes in your plans. @lizmillerfit&#34;&gt;Life always throws a monkey-wrench, and just when you think everything is going to go your way, something changes in your plans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to just go with it, and make the most of what you set out to do. I want to nip this cold in the bud, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing everything I can to take care of myself and make a 80-90% recovery before going back to the gym. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk about being &amp;ldquo;tough&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bro&amp;rdquo; or whatever when it comes to training while sick. I personally think that it&amp;rsquo;s dumb to train when you&amp;rsquo;re not feeling well. Your mind will be focused on how terrible you feel rather than focusing on perfecting your form. Rest up, get over the cold or illness, and the gym will be there when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to return.
The other part of training while sick is that your body is already trying to &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; off the illness. When you throw in additional stressors, such as lack of sleep, lifting, etc., it makes it difficult for your body to get rid of it. I think this is why people end up with these &amp;ldquo;lingering&amp;rdquo; colds for weeks and months. They don&amp;rsquo;t give their bodies&amp;rsquo; the breaks they need in order to see full recovery. So, do yourself a favor and sleep!
For me, I notice the onset of an illness when I don&amp;rsquo;t get 7-8 hours of sleep consistently, and I am working 10+ hour days, and working out, and doing too much. So the illness is an alarm telling me &amp;ldquo;hey! you need to take a break!&amp;rdquo; So tonight&amp;rsquo;s chest workout is still tentative. It&amp;rsquo;s about 9:30am here, and I have many hours to figure out if I&amp;rsquo;m going to train tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to cut this article off here, but thank you, if you have read this far, and I will be back with another article on Day 3 of 5/3/1, whether that is tonight or this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write a series of articles on my experience with training. This is the intro article for my &amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1&amp;rdquo; series. Over the next 8 weeks, I will be doing 5/3/1 with the focus on body recomposition and strength gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this like your typical fitness youtuber&amp;rsquo;s vlog without the video edits. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go into my routine, my day-to-day training progress, and some tips to help you along the way. Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;finishing-up-hypertrophy-training&#34;&gt;Finishing up Hypertrophy Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on hypertrophy training with 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps: getting the volume up (&lt;em&gt;weight x reps x sets&lt;/em&gt;) while maintaining form. Each workout I try to increase the weight I did the previous time by at least 5 or 10 pounds. If I previously did sets with a weight of 50, then I&amp;rsquo;ll go to 55 or 60 lbs for the current workout. It&amp;rsquo;s time to shift gears and focus on getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-the-program-a-very-quick-5-3-1-summary&#34;&gt;Getting the program &amp;amp; a very quick 5/3/1 summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next training plan will focus on lean strength gains. I&amp;rsquo;m picking up Jim Wendler&amp;rsquo;s 5/3/1 from Dec 4 - Jan 31. I generated my program plan using &lt;a href=&#34;http://strengthstandards.co&#34;&gt;Strength Standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/3/1 is a training protocol created by Jim Wendler. One &amp;ldquo;training cycle&amp;rdquo; of this program is 4-weeks long, with four &amp;ldquo;training routines&amp;rdquo; each week. The training routines are centered around improving the &amp;ldquo;big 4&amp;rdquo; (bench, squat, deadlift, and press) plus a few accessory movements. At the start of every routine, there are three warm-up sets, followed by 3 working sets. The number of reps done is based on the training week: week 1 is 5+ reps, week 2 is 3+ reps, week 3 is 1+ rep(s). The goal is to hit a minimum of the prescribed number of reps for each set. Week 4 is a deload week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 5&amp;rsquo;s training numbers are determined off of week 3&amp;rsquo;s 1RM lifts:
- For squats and deadlifts, take 90% of your week 3 1RM and add 10lbs.
- For bench and press, take 90% of your week 3 1RM and add 5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue subsequential cycles of 5/3/1 using the format outlined above for weeks 5-8. For more detailed information on 5/3/1 check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength&#34;&gt;full program here.&lt;/a&gt;  Now let&amp;rsquo;s get into this first article of my &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; blog series!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: There are many variations of 5/3/1, but for this series, I will be completing two cycles of &amp;ldquo;Boring But Big.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-shouldn-t-be-this-easy&#34;&gt;it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this easy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said above, last week, I generated my 5/3/1 program using Strength Standards and my most recent stats for each of the &amp;ldquo;big 4.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m following the 90% of 1RM training protocol, so the numbers I&amp;rsquo;m hitting this week look and seem &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; light. I don&amp;rsquo;t suspect I will see a whole lot of difficulties until week 3. The nature of 5/3/1 is to start a few steps backwards in weight and then work up to heavier-than-normal weights (3 steps backwards and 5 steps forwards&amp;hellip; or something like that). I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this style of training before, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what strength gains occur over the next eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s military press routine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm-up:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 x 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40 x 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 x 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 x 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 x 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;65 x 5+ (going for as many reps possible - I estimate that I can do about 12-15 at 65 lbs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessory work:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;military press:  5 x 10 at 40 lb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chin-ups: 5 x 10 at bodyweight (going to do a &amp;ldquo;rest-pause&amp;rdquo; style on this exercise)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;nutrition-life-and-other-musings&#34;&gt;nutrition, life, and other musings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Monday, so my day started very early. I woke up at 4:15am to be at work, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for a 5:30am start. Lately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt as hungry, so eating all of my macros has been a huge challenge. (Since when is 2000 calories &amp;ldquo;a lot&amp;rdquo;??!) This week my macros are 155 protein, 250 carbs, 47 fats: a nice 30-50-20 split.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also decided to go &amp;ldquo;gluten-free&amp;rdquo; during these eight weeks because I have been having a lot of issues with acne. In the past, when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating as flexibly, and had a staple of about eight different foods (none of which were processed or contained gluten), I had the clearest skin of my life. So, these next few weeks, I am going to completely avoid eating gluten, which means I won&amp;rsquo;t be enduldging in my &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; favorite post-deadlift meal of waffles. :( I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you posted on my progress with a &lt;em&gt;gluten-free &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iifym.com&#34;&gt;iifym&lt;/a&gt; nutrition plan&lt;/em&gt;. Not sure how hypocritical that sounds, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to solve a lot of the skin problems I&amp;rsquo;ve been having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toughest thing about being gluten-free and on iifym is CARBS. Seriously, how many potatoes or servings of rice or bowls of gluten-free Chex can a person eat in a day? It&amp;rsquo;s been a struggle to eat enough carbs and enough calories lately. Throw in a lack of hunger, and it&amp;rsquo;s a short recipe for disaster. While it may not seem as dramatic as I&amp;rsquo;m making it, (&lt;em&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not&lt;/em&gt;), I am planning to start cutting in exactly four-weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&amp;rsquo;s that such a problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, if I&amp;rsquo;m in a deficit now, then I will have to drop my calories even lower to be in a deficit then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/home?status=Combine a caloric deficit with the proper weight training program and consistency, and you will lose weight! @lizmillerfit&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weight loss is a seemingly easy thing: combine a modest 25% caloric deficit with the proper weight training program, and a lot of consistency, and you will lose weight!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficult part about being at a slight deficit now is that my &amp;ldquo;modest 25% caloric deficit&amp;rdquo; at the start of my weight loss journey, will end up being less than 1500 calories, which is pretty darn low for me. So now is the time to get and keep my calories up. Starting today, I will do my very best to eat to my numbers! And to keep me accountable, add me on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/stronglizlifts&#34;&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;. I will be tracking my foods and supplements on there daily, so if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for food options or just want to see what I&amp;rsquo;m up to, that will be the most up-to-date reference. I will also add in measurements (weight, % fat, waist, hips, chest, arms, thighs, etc.) at a minimum each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-goals-and-aspirations-for-this-series-the-5-3-1-program-and-my-physique&#34;&gt;my goals and aspirations for this series, the 5/3/1 program, and my physique&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What better place and time to outline my purpose for this than right here and right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to create this online blog series &amp;ldquo;life on 5/3/1&amp;rdquo; to outline the day-to-day challenges, struggles, successes, and indifferences that come along with training for strength and body recomposition. One of the coolest parts about doing a series like this is being able to provide the &lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt; perspective of the 5/3/1 program. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to compare my progress and results to previous training programs and to see if this method works well for me (and is enjoyable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;this-series&#34;&gt;this series:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posting on each training day for a minimum of four posts per week (32 posts total)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include pictures and media during my training, meal prep, and weigh-ins, where appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-3-1-goals&#34;&gt;5/3/1 goals:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;achieve the prescribed 1RMs for week 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain the training schedule (no missed training sessions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perform 10 reps of chin-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-physique&#34;&gt;my physique:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain body composition: ~154 lbs at ~24% bodyfat at the end of December 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;body recomposition: ~145 lb at 22% bodyfat at the end of January 2017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clearer skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better digestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restful sleep: ~7 hours avg per night&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>a 10-minute cool-down routine</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/ten-minute-routine/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2016 10:54:42 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://queenflex.github.io/post/ten-minute-routine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes we overlook the cool-down routine as much as our warm-up routine. I think it has something to do with wanting to get to the exciting part of the workout and both warm-ups and cool-downs are &amp;ldquo;boring.&amp;rdquo; I used to think that these routines were a waste of time, but that was before I knew just how much benefit they provide the body. This article explains a quick, ten-minute recovery routine that you can do practically anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, you will need the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopwatch or Timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chair or something about 2-feet off the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat Surface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This routine is a circuit of four different exercises that are best performed post-workout or at a time when you want to &amp;ldquo;relax.&amp;rdquo; They are taken from the exercises recommended by Maraynn Berry&amp;rsquo;s article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://breakingmuscle.com/video/5-simple-exercises-to-eliminate-neck-pain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;5 Simple Exercises to Eliminate Neck Pain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be alarmed. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be experiencing neck pain in order to do these exercises! I find that this condensed version allows my body to &amp;ldquo;reset&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;relax&amp;rdquo; especially after a heavy lifting session. This routine is especially beneficial for desk jockies because it promotes proper posture from the neck, through the shoulders, down to the hips and adductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each exercise in this routine, you will hold the position for two minutes. There are five exercises total, therefore, ten-minutes of &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; time for this routine. I recommend you read through the exercise, and then give them a try! Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-exercise-1-u-static-back&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Exercise 1:&lt;/u&gt;  Static Back:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lay on the floor with your legs propped up on a chair or object 2-feet tall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your legs should be at a 90-degree angle to your hips. &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hold this position for 2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-exercise-2-u-static-scapular-extension&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Exercise 2:&lt;/u&gt;  Static Scapular Extension:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start on all fours, ensuring that your wrists are directly under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk your hands about 6-inches in front of the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift your hips forward so that your weight and shoulders are over your wrists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your elbows straight and allow your shoulder blades to sink down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your head hang. Release any tension in your neck and mouth. &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;It will be challenging, but try to hold this position for 2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; While it seems counter-intuitive to hold this position, since we spend most of our day in a slouched over position, this exercise moves the scapula into extension, promoting realignment to the shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-exercise-3-u-repeat-exercise-1-static-back&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Exercise 3:&lt;/u&gt;  Repeat Exercise 1, Static Back.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hold this position for 2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-exercise-4-u-wall-hold&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Exercise 4:&lt;/u&gt;  Wall Hold:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit on the floor with your back and head against a wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull your shoulder blades together and down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest your legs straight out in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex your quads. Flex your feet towards your body. &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hold this position for 2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-exercise-5-u-static-adductor-frog&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Exercise 5:&lt;/u&gt;  Static Adductor (Frog):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in a seated position with the bottoms of your feet touching each other (a.k.a. butterfly position). Make sure that your feet are aligned with the center of your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie back and relax every muscle in your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put your arms at a 45-degree angle to your sides with your palms facing up. &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hold this position for 2 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give this routine a try after your next workout or before bed. After a week of doing this routine, it&amp;rsquo;ll become second-nature and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that it helps with recovery and &amp;ldquo;resets&amp;rdquo; your posture.&lt;/p&gt;

Just type in your currrent stats, your best &lt;em&gt;weight x reps&lt;/em&gt; for the big 4 (bench, squat, deadlift, press), and Strength Standards will tell you how you compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website can also be used to generate progressions. If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in a plateau with any of your lifts, you can generate progressions for popular lifting programs (5/3/1, Stronglifts, Cube Method, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Strength Standards is a great tool for benchmarking your current strength relative to your current size. The only downfall is you cannot &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo; your progress with Strength Standards. Because of this, I recommend taking a look at the Strong App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.strengthstandards.co&#34;&gt;www.strengthstandards.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a name=&#34;strongapp&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strong-app-for-ios&#34;&gt;Strong (App for iOS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track your progress on any lift with this app for iOS. I have been using this app since Jan 2016, and let me tell you, it beats out the pencil-paper method by a million. (And I was an avid user of notebooks and training templates throughout the years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an iDevice, switching to Strong provides you the simplicity of a notebook without the complexity and hassle of determining how much weight, how many sets/reps, and what you need to do in order to achieve progressive overload. You can see the exact weight and reps you did previously for each exercise, and that&amp;rsquo;s something that you cannot do with a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong allows you to create custom workout routines and exercises and also provides a built-in set timer, warm-up calculator, and plate calculator. You can mark sets as &amp;ldquo;warm-up&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;drop-set&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to see progress over time, because each completed routine is added to the master calendar and PR&amp;rsquo;s are recorded into charts for each exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong stores all your data in the cloud and has the option to integrate with Facebook. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s provided me with a great value for the price. Note, I am not endorsed to say anything positive about Strong. I have had such a great experience with the app, and it&amp;rsquo;s constantly receiving updates (buy the full version with upgrades in perpetuity!) by their development team. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/home?status=@lizmillerfit @strongapp I just visited http://strongapp.io via queenflex.com. What an awesome fitness tracking app!&#34;&gt;Have a look at it, and let me know what you think!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever struggle to figure out how much weight you should use per set during a 1-rep-max test?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, look no further! Here&amp;rsquo;s a calculator that you can use to determine how much weight you should use for each of your warm-up and working sets in order to reach your target 1RM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input your target 1RM weight into the &amp;ldquo;target 1RM weight&amp;rdquo; field as well as the set number. The calculator will output the number of reps and respective weight you should hit for the given set. All calculations are based on the recommendations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t-nation.com/training/how-to-warm-up-for-a-one-rep-max&#34;&gt;this T-Nation article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Mike. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a terrible name for a child. It&amp;rsquo;s actually the name of a terribly difficult workout program by Ashley Horner and Bodybuilding.com. You&amp;rsquo;re probably reading this because you&amp;rsquo;re curious about starting this program or you found my article posted on Facebook and figured you&amp;rsquo;d give it a read (thank you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;program-overview&#34;&gt;program overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military, &amp;ldquo;Charlie Mike&amp;rdquo; is a command meaning &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Continue Mission.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Each of Horner&amp;rsquo;s workouts is a mini &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; that you have to overcome. The program is 6-weeks long and each week has a theme: week 1 is &amp;ldquo;Try&amp;rdquo;; week 2 is &amp;ldquo;Believe&amp;rdquo;; week 3 is &amp;ldquo;Commit&amp;rdquo;; week 4 is &amp;ldquo;Conquer&amp;rdquo;; week 5 is &amp;ldquo;Earn It&amp;rdquo;; week 6 is &amp;ldquo;Prove it&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t let these themes fool you though. The workouts are tough from the very beginning! &amp;ldquo;Try&amp;rdquo; will certainly become a motif on day 1 of the program. (This is especially true if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from a background of low-intensity work). You may even get a few stares from your average gym-goers because they&amp;rsquo;re thinking, &amp;ldquo;dang, what kind of workout is (s)he doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;30&#34; src=&#34;http://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2016/february/Charlie_Mike-NLA-FINAL-desktop-logo.png&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence about doing this program, you should stop thinking about doing it and just dive in. The more you ponder whether or not this routine is for you, the more you will talk yourself out of it. Don&amp;rsquo;t over-analyze the routine. I&amp;rsquo;ll simplify it for you here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each routine follows a similar format: 1 compound exercise followed by 1-2 high-intensity interval circuits and some running/rowing sprinkled in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s the best of both worlds: you get to work your strength while becoming more agile. For me, this program was such a good choice for the summertime because there&amp;rsquo;s something so rewarding about working until you&amp;rsquo;re about to die during the summer months. (Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because when you walk out of the gym as a sweaty mess, you&amp;rsquo;re greeted by the summer sun and all the happy feelings of summer. Plus, there&amp;rsquo;s always the opportunity to hang poolside with a cold one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-m-a-charlie-mike-fan&#34;&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m a Charlie Mike Fan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This program makes you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re training for something that matters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this program, I was stuck in a training rut. I was hitting my typical compound lifts with some accessory work thrown in here and there. While my lifts were progressing, I just felt stale. Training wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly enjoyable because I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was working towards any specific goal. This program provides everything you need in order to feel like you&amp;rsquo;re achieving something ridiculously awesome each training day. Because the program is named after a military command, it made me appreciate those who train this hard all the time in order to protect our nation and our freedom.
The program begins with about a week’s worth of finding your 1-rep-max (1RM) for the following compound lifts: back squat, front squat, deadlift, bench press, and push press. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a calculator to help you determine the number of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.queenflex.com/p/one-rep-max-1rm-warm-up-calculator.html&#34;&gt;reps per set for a 1RM test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 1RM test, you&amp;rsquo;ll jump right into a few cardio circuits. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what a typical day looks like (strength + conditioning):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GETfCoTJcUA/V7DhHSqYpcI/AAAAAAAABDk/0y4HTrZEpagaqRoE7ZXHVo__7IwVWgWCgCLcB/s1600/charlie-mike-example-day16.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Mike Day 16 from Bodybuilding.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of rest, Horner does a great job at emphasizing proper rest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was over-trained at all during this program; however, I did have to modify some of the routines to accommodate my schedule. After each conditioning circuit, you&amp;rsquo;re told to take 5-10 minutes of rest, which I found to be plenty of time to both recover and to get ready for the next circuit. Some days I needed closer to 10 minutes of rest, while other days I was ready to go in 5. Just be sure to time yourself because time tends to move quickly when you&amp;rsquo;re in &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bonus to this program is that there is a dedicated Charlie Mike App to help track your workouts! It&amp;rsquo;s not an overly complex app, and you can&amp;rsquo;t log data in it; however, it is much better than printing the PDFs off of Bodybuidling.com or trying to view the exercises on the mobile website. I especially liked not having to plan out any routines for the 6-week period. Each day was a different set of exercises, all of which proved to be difficult in their own ways.
Nothing is perfect, that includes Charlie Mike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A downfall to this program is the lack of definitive nutrition plan. I think that nutrition is a major part of any training program; however, Horner did not specify what the macronutrient amounts or percentages should be during this program. This is left to you to figure out. She does recommend eating a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods, which is the standard recommendation in any program. I ate pretty liberally during this program and didn&amp;rsquo;t follow a specific meal plan. Right now though, I am following your typical principles of IIFYM (if it fits your macros) and am eating roughly 40-40-20 (protein-carbs-fat). If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in dialing in your nutrition, this may not be the exact program for you. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend finding a nutrition program or coach to help you figure out your numbers. Nutrition can make or break your performance, so to be successful on this program, you will want to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re eating enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3f3LP2LeNqk/V7DHJIwqgRI/AAAAAAAABCs/CgCnjVp4QBMrtLKNQ3Eyu-vO7sOgT0UEQCLcB/s1600/it-doesnt-get-easier-you-get-better.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; Week 1 was tough. &lt;em&gt;But so was Week 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My body was just more adapted to handle the workouts over time.
Charlie Mike was not a breeze. It was just as tough on week 6 as it was on week 1. I found that each workout was progressively more difficult even with an increased work capacity. I was never bored with these routines because once I was warmed up and into my first cardio circuit, the feeling was analogous to a &amp;ldquo;runner&amp;rsquo;s high.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far and still aren&amp;rsquo;t convinced this workout is for you, then okay, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not. So for that reason alone, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the reasons why you &lt;u&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/u&gt; try Charlie Mike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want an easy workout routine for a deload or relaxation training cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to focus on strength or hypertrophy or cardio, separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t want to sweat during your workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re starting a cutting diet cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re afraid to step out of your comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re injured. (Seriously, rest up and get better before exercising!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t want to look like a crazy at your globo-gym.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note this isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete list of why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give this a try. Personally, I think if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this far and are on the fence about trying it, you&amp;rsquo;re just looking for excuses. (Lame)
Final Thoughts and Program Rating&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Rotten Tomatoes rates movies, here are my ratings for Charlie Mike in the categories of program exercises, schedule, nutrition, recovery, and overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exercises&lt;/strong&gt;  ★  ★  ★  ★  ★  &lt;br&gt;
Charlie Mike has a variety of exercises including your fundamental compound lifts as well as olympic lifts: thrusters, cleans, clean &amp;amp; jerks. Strength and conditioning is included in every workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;schedule&lt;/strong&gt; ★  ★  ★  ★ &lt;br&gt;
The schedule was pretty easy to follow. Each workout follows the same structure: strength + conditioning circuits. Days can be interchanged as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; ★  ★  &lt;br&gt;
This program does not provide a specific nutrition program with complete macronutrients or diet recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recovery&lt;/strong&gt; ★  ★  ★  ★ &lt;br&gt;
There is plenty of recovery time between exercises and between workout days. Like schedule, workouts can be rearranged to accommodate your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;overall&lt;/strong&gt; ★  ★  ★  ★ &lt;br&gt;
Overall this routine was one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve completed from Bodybuilding.com. I highly recommend trying it if your current routine is stale, or if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to pump up the intensity in your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6-weeks of Charlie Mike, all of my compound lifts have increased in weight. My endurance and my performance have also improved significantly. Charlie Mike was a mentally and physically challenging program, which upon completion made me realize that I’m a lot stronger than I thought I was. My mission was successfully completed. Now it’s your turn. &lt;em&gt;Are you up for the challenge?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; hspace=&#34;10&#34; src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hpnB2MhMJMI/V3Pec6UCEMI/AAAAAAAAA-o/xYhk-6vhy-sQ4PytNIg3_y_d1YzXw8uYwCLcB/s1600/five-tips-to-reach-your-fitness-goals.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here it is, half-way through 2016. Have you stuck to your New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions? Have you lost the 10 pounds you were planning to lose in January? Maybe the summer weather came sooner than you had planned. Well fret no more; here are five things you should know about achieving your fitness goals as we head into the second half of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-understand-the-bigger-picture&#34;&gt;1) Understand the bigger picture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does fitness matter to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to fit into particular clothes? Do you use gym-time as a method to reduce stress? Do you want to look a certain way? Do you want to live a healthy and happy life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your reason may be, you need to be honest with yourself and define the bigger picture. While fitness magazines and websites make healthy living seem so amazing and glamorous, you have to know your why. Not their why or my why, yours. After all, fitness and healthy living is an investment to yourself, so you might as well make it about you and the things that you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go ahead, sit down and ask yourself &lt;strong&gt;WHY?&lt;/strong&gt;. Why does fitness and health matter to me? And once you ask yourself &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; once, go ahead and ask yourself three to four more times. By the fifth &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;, you should have a pretty good understanding of the bigger picture. Once you know the bigger picture, you can decompose your end goal into a smaller subset of goals. Think of these mini-goals as stepping-stones that will help you get closer to your end goal. This is the most important tip to achieving your fitness goals, so be sure to spend some time really considering what your aspirations are and how you can break those larger goals down into smaller milestones. Once you complete this activity, you will have a better understanding of how to get to where you want to be and can spend time working at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-eat-according-to-your-daily-plans&#34;&gt;2) Eat according to your daily plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to preface this point with the idea of being realistic and developing a healthy mindset around food and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical that you eat enough food for what you&amp;rsquo;re doing during the day. For example, if you are sitting and watching TV, you will not need as much food versus hitting a workout consisting of heavy squats and deadlifts. So on days you plan to workout longer than an hour or WOD for more than twenty minutes, it&amp;rsquo;s important you fuel your body so that it can perform optimally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few fundamental ideas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re going through a weight loss cycle, you need to eat fewer calories than your body burns throughout a day. [AKA Caloric Deficit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to put on weight, you need to eat more calories than your body burns throughout a day. [AKA Caloric Surplus]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with that said, you must also realize that you can&amp;rsquo;t always spend every day in a Caloric Deficit or a Caloric Surplus; it is important that you take breaks from dieting and bulking and spend time maintaining. Metabolism is meant to be dynamic, so incorporating days or periods of time where you eat more and then less, is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I like to do is spend 6-10 weeks at a Caloric Deficit to lose some weight, and then slowly reverse diet out of the deficit to a maintenance calorie level. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll spend 3-4 months in a caloric surplus to promote muscle growth. I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat this cycle until I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with how my figure looks and according to how I feel from a health standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-find-foods-you-like-incorporate-them-into-your-meals&#34;&gt;3) Find foods you like &amp;amp; incorporate them into your meals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat foods you like. It sounds simple, but if you force yourself to eat “healthy” foods that you don’t like, then it’s going to be a rough battle for you to maintain. Now don’t get me wrong, this point is NOT about eating chicken wings and mac and cheese. (We both know you like those foods; however, a diet of chicken wings and mac and cheese isn’t overly healthy in the long run).  A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet of carbohydrates (vegetables, starches, sugars), fats (oils, butters), and proteins (meat, dairy). Try to incorporate as many vegetables and meats that you enjoy eating into your diet. This will make it easier to commit to fitness over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “healthy foods&amp;rdquo; is a slight misconception because what one person thinks is healthy, another person may disagree. I will let you decide what you think is healthy for you; however, a tip that I like to use when picking out food is whether or not the food has been processed (unhealthy), grown on a farm (healthy), or hunted (healthy). That’s not to say that all process foods are created equal: old fashioned oats are different than Cheetos, for example. Use your best judgment when preparing your meals. It’s okay to have most foods in moderation! It’s all about balance and consistency and what contributes to making you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-train-smarter-and-harder&#34;&gt;4) Train Smarter and Harder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that always is brought up in the fitness world is training. Today’s thought is that &lt;em&gt;“less is more”&lt;/em&gt; and short workouts are better than longer workouts. My response to that is that it depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a short workout without any intensity, such as going for a 10 minute walk, that is a lot different than completing a high-intensity interval workout for 10 minutes. While both are 10 minutes, there are studies that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) promotes more fat loss in 10 minutes versus 45-60 minutes of low-intensity training, such as walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I think walking is one of the most important exercises one could do to promote long-term health and wellness; however, if your goal is fat loss (who doesn’t want to lose fat), try to plan your workouts around increased intensity and heavier weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training smarter also includes choosing exercises that you enjoy doing and a schedule that complements your lifestyle. You shouldn’t be “living to train”; you should be “training to live.” If your routine isn’t one you can stick to, then you won’t be enjoying your time training nor will you have a high likelihood of sticking to the routine over time. Consistency is a huge part of fitness, so the more you can stick to the schedule, the better chance you have of reaching your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must challenge yourself if you want to make any progress. For example, if you continuously choose the same weight for the same number of sets and reps, you will not progress to higher weights. Be reasonable, and increase the weight as the exercise becomes easier. Make small adjustments and over time you will see major improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-own-the-decisions-that-you-make-and-be-okay-with-the-outcomes&#34;&gt;5) Own the decisions that you make and be okay with the outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wise person once told me &lt;em&gt;“you may not be where you want to be, but you’re where you should be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not be as strong or fast or as aesthetic as you may want to be, but based on your current actions, you are where you should be. Keep going; be consistent; and work towards being better each day. You won’t be perfect, but having peace with yourself will go a long ways. You have to be your own advocate; no one else can do that for you. Give yourself a realistic amount of time to reach your goals and be honest with yourself about the decisions you make to reach them. 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort. As mentioned before, train smarter and harder and reap the benefits of putting in the work to get to where you want to be. Reassess your progress regularly (weekly, monthly, etc) so that you have a feel for when expectations and milestones should be met. You have complete control of your life, so own the work that you do; own how you speak to yourself; and own the results of your actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it: the five things you should know about fitness as we head into Q3 of 2016. And if this article was &amp;ldquo;TL;DR&amp;rdquo;, I encourage you to scroll up and at least read each of the 5 bullet points. Go ahead and do some soul-searching. Find out the bigger picture, your bigger purpose. Eat according to your goals. Choose foods that you enjoy eating that are satiating and nutritious. Develop a smart training plan and go into each workout with a plan. Increase the weights on key lifts over time. And realize that you’re the driver to your destination. Own every decision that you make – the good and the bad. Be okay with who you are and what you stand for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try out these tips and let me know how you fare. Get at it! &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hi@queenflex.com&#34;&gt;-QFB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>my perspective on daily undulating periodization (dup)</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/daily-undulating-periodization/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2016 18:30:55 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP) is all the rage these days. For a &amp;ldquo;program hopper&amp;rdquo; like myself, I find that DUP is a great way to feel like you&amp;rsquo;re doing something different each training session, without actually sacrificing progress, strength, or hypertrophy goals. The structure for DUP varies from person-to-person; however, since I am fairly new to this concept of training, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to shed some light and decompose the process of setting up a DUP training program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a few things to consider before writing your own DUP program: strength vs. hypertrophy, number of rest days, personal enjoyment exercises, etc. With that said, I have written this article to help you better assess DUP and whether or not it is the right programming style for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me introduce you to my little friend,&amp;rdquo; DUP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I jump right into my process for DUP programming, I&amp;rsquo;d like to briefly explain the principles behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jmaxfitness.com/blog/daily-undulating-periodization/&#34;&gt;Daily Undulating Periodization.&lt;/a&gt; The concept is summarized in rather simple terms: for each training day, the routine includes exercises that are assigned a number of reps (rep scheme). The rep scheme changes each training session over the course of a training period (usually 4-6 weeks). Rep schemes are typically in one of three categories: strength (4-6 reps), hypertrophy (8-12 reps), endurance (15-20 reps). If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to become a more &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; athlete with your training, you may choose to have different rep schemes within the same training session (i.e. exercise 1 for 4 reps, exercise 2 for 8 reps, exercise 3 for 15 reps) or alternate rep schemes throughout a training week. In order to create a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.muscleforlife.com/guide-to-muscle-hypertrophy-muscle-growth/&#34;&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt; using DUP, you must increase volume your volume. Training volume can be increased a number of ways, but my two go-to methods are 1) using an as many reps as possible (AMRAP) set to determine whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re ready to increase the weight the next training week; or 2) increasing the number of sets each week within the training period (weight stays the same through the training period). Ok, so now that you have a brief understanding of DUP, I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a simple methodology to create a DUP training program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;programming-for-daily-undulating-periodization&#34;&gt;programming for daily undulating periodization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;balance: the human body is a complex system, so training routines are meant to be simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-dup-routine-has-four-main-components&#34;&gt;a DUP routine has four main components:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental Exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rep Scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Period Length/Deload Schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fundamental-exercises&#34;&gt;fundamental exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about &amp;ldquo;fundamental exercises&amp;rdquo;, what I really mean are your &amp;ldquo;main lifts&amp;rdquo; or the &lt;strong&gt;compound lifts&lt;/strong&gt; you want to include in your program: squats, bench, deadlifts, presses, and variations of these lifts. What I typically do is pick three compound lifts to work in a training period. For example, my current program includes front squats, barbell bench press, and rack pulls. The goal is to pick the exercises that you need to work. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rep-scheme&#34;&gt;rep scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your exercises picked, you need to decide on
your rep scheme. As I stated in the introduction, you can either train
the same rep scheme for each exercise or have a separate rep scheme for each exercise and rotate them throughout a training week. My current program does the latter and 4, 6, and 10 reps each training day, one rep scheme per exercise (i.e. front squat for 4 reps, bench press for 6 reps, and rack pull for 10 reps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-scheme&#34;&gt;set scheme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s great, but how many sets should I be doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to that question depends on how you want to attack progressive overload. The idea is to have as few variables as possible, while still seeing a maximum result [check out this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4hourlife.com/2012/11/26/the-4-hour-chef-finding-the-minimum-effectiv%20e-dose-med-of-life/&#34;&gt;Minimum Effective Dose&lt;/a&gt;]. For the sake of keeping this article concise, I will only touch on two ways to determine your set scheme: keep the number of sets constant throughout the training cycle and increase the weight used for each exercise each week or increase the number of sets each week while keeping the weight used for each exercise constant. Right now my training period is four weeks long; the first week I do 2 sets; second week 3 sets; third week is 4 sets (3 sets + 1 set AMRAP); fourth week is 2 sets or deload. You can follow this pattern as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former method calls for increasing the weight by 5-10 lbs per exercise per week as long as you have achieved all of your sets and reps for each exercise. If you fail your bench press at 225 for 7 reps when you should have gotten 10, then you probably aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to increase the weight for that exercise. The goal is to make progress on your lifts without sacrificing form, mobility, and overall quality of the movement. A good way to test whether or not you are ready to move up in weight is to do an AMRAP set on your last set of the week prior to deload (i.e. for me, on my 3rd week, my fourth set is an AMRAP set). If you beat the number of reps than prescribed for &amp;gt;85% of your training days for each exercise, respectively, then you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go up in weight on the first week of the next training cycle. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about training period length and deloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;period-length-deload-schedule&#34;&gt;period length/deload schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need to decide how long you want your training period to last. A training period can last anywhere from 4-6 or 4-8 weeks, but ultimately depends on your preference, how your body feels with training, and the overall progress you&amp;rsquo;re making. For me, I like to take a deload week on the 4th week of the training cycle by dropping back to 2 sets as I do on week 1. This allows me to recover better and reduces the likelihood that I get burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also follow a 2-days on, 1 day off schedule where the off-day alternates between either a full day of rest/yoga day or an &amp;ldquo;accessory day&amp;rdquo; where I focus on 10-12 isolation movements to help with hypertrophy. For the accessory day, I follow the same set scheme as the week and keep the rep scheme constant at 10-15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/double-stimulation-training&#34;&gt;interesting finding&lt;/a&gt; that says 24 hours after training a muscle group, you have greater ability to increase muscle mass by training it again during that timeframe. This is mainly why I use a 2-day on, 1 day off pattern rather than 5-day on, 2 day off training pattern. I also believe that since you&amp;rsquo;re undulating the rep scheme each day, you have the ability to recover slightly, but also stimulate the muscle enough to continue mass building. I am still playing around with how this works for me personally, but I&amp;rsquo;d be curious to know if any of you have had success with this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-video&#34;&gt;reference video&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still slightly confused? Have a look at this video for a visual demonstration of programming for DUP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>combat office slouch</title>
      <link>https://queenflex.github.io/post/office-slouch/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;stop-being-such-a-slouch&#34;&gt;Stop being such a slouch!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and work a desk job, it is easy to turn into a slouched over mess. With all the hype out there about &amp;ldquo;sitting is the new smoking&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prehab is rehab&amp;rdquo;, I have decided to create a list of the most realistic exercises that you can do at the office to help improve posture, mobility, and overall happiness. &lt;em&gt;And hopefully prevent you from looking like a stupid fool, rolling around on the floor next to your cubical.&lt;/em&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: the advice I&amp;rsquo;m providing here is based off of my personal experience with chronic low back, hip, neck, and shoulder pain, and does not substitute or replace medical advice. These tricks have worked for me based on meeting with a physical therapist for my own mobility/stability issues; however, everybody is different, and it&amp;rsquo;s best to seek an opinion from your doctor prior to trying a rehab/stretch/strength program like the one I am about to outline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to working a full-time desk job, I was a college student. When people think college, they may think parties, alcohol, weight gain, and craziness; however, the reality of my college experience was hair-pulling, weight loss, walking everywhere, and craziness. Once I found myself sitting at the same desk for hours on end with little reason to move other than to get water or use the bathroom, I realized I was becoming a slouched over mess. [Cue the mobility issues, back and hip pain.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this &amp;ldquo;neat&amp;rdquo; little thing about exercise: you can work out for an hour—maybe even two hours—a day, but if you are &lt;a href=&#34;http://breakingmuscle.com/health-medicine/its-not-your-metabolism-its-your-neat-thats-stopping-your-fat-loss&#34;&gt;inactive for 8-15 hours a day, then exercise less effective&lt;/a&gt;. So why is that so “neat” you may ask? Well it has to do with &lt;strong&gt;N.E.A.T or non-exercise activity thermogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;, aka “what you do when you’re not exercising, which burns calories to keep you alive.” So if you put yourself into a lethargic, slumped over position all day long, and think you will have great mobility for your squat session that evening, well good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-prevent-becoming-an-immobile-mess-of-a-human-being&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I prevent becoming an immobile mess of a human being?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simple answer:&lt;/u&gt; get off your butt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simple answer explained:&lt;/u&gt; Every 30-45 minutes, get up and perform a series of mobility/stability exercises to counterbalance the poor posture from sitting. Think back to eighth-grade science class where you learned about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-4/Newton-s-Third-Law&#34;&gt;Newton’s Third Law&lt;/a&gt;. (For you engineers out there, forgive me, this was a very recent topic for y’all). Newton’s Third Law states that for every action force there is a reaction force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, if you’re sitting in a slouched over position, inducing flexion on your spine, it’d be wise to get up every half hour and do some back bends to induce extension. Refer to the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://teachmeanatomy.info/wp-content/uploads/Terms-of-Movement-Flexion-and-Extension-CC-1024x815.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; height=&#34;45%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-15-minute-routine-to-combat-office-slouch&#34;&gt;A 15-minute routine to combat office slouch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a reason why people who live in a constant state of flexion throw their backs out when they pick up a basket of laundry; it’s because they’re inducing extension on a spine that has been molded into the flexion world. It’s time to teach our spines, and other body parts for that matter, what neutral looks like. To do this, I have developed a short list of five exercises that I think are the most effective for resetting the body and prehab for future injuries. You only need therabands/resistance bands to perform all the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you live in the world of &lt;u&gt;extension&lt;/u&gt;, you would probably benefit from &lt;u&gt;flexion&lt;/u&gt; exercises instead of exercises two and three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder W&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt;
Grasp a theraband on either end keep your elbows by your sides. Contract your lats and pull the band apart forming a &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo; with your arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_G0feLqXA0E&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing back-bends (extension)&lt;/strong&gt;
Position your feet slightly behind your hips. Place your hands on your low back (or table as shown in the video), and slowly bend backwards. You will feel this stretch in your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjXCgxajrY4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prone Press-ups (extension)&lt;/strong&gt;
Lie on the floor and place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Contract your lats and press up with your arms. You should feel a stretch in the low back. Exhale at the top of the movement for a deeper low-back stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCOt_Em11g8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder Stars&lt;/strong&gt;
Grasp a theraband on either end and hit 6 points to form the shape of a star as shown in the video. Contract your lats and make sure that your shoulders are relaxed and not shrugged up towards your ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTCvBqZz3Bc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/strong&gt;
Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart and that you contract your glutes while hinging at the hips. When you come down, try to break just below parallel and come back up. If you feel this in your lower back, you should compare your form to the example in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;90%&#34; height=&#34;75%&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3g4wAsu0R4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to perform these exercises every 30-45 minutes (set a timer!) throughout the work day to prevent poor posture and to prehab the body from potential future injuries. Hopefully, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to hit the gym, your body is already primed for the upcoming movements and you&amp;rsquo;ll be less stiff and sore afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give these exercises a try, and let me know if they work for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
